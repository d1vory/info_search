PREFACE. 



It is believed that this work makes a new departure in the 
books provided for students under the title of " Leading " or 
" Selected " Cases. The method hitherto employed is that of 
giving a leading case and appending to it a dissertation upon 
various matters that appear to the author to be germane to the 
principle of the leading case itself. 

To follow this course would be to give a repetition of the 
matter contained in the text- books to which this work on 
leading cases is intended to be a companion volume. One 
result of the form in which leading cases have hitherto been 
published is that to reach such leading cases as are necessary 
the student has to peruse a number of more or less bulky 
volumes, one dealing with common law cases, another with 
equity cases, and so forth. 

Even then the volumes now available do not cover the 
entire ground of the student's reading for any of the ordinary 
examinations, such as the Solicitors' or the Bar Final. 

The method adopted in the present work is to set out the 
facts of the leading or some illustrative cise in sufficient detail 
to give it actuality and vividness, and then to give the substance 
of the judgment. All such comment as the student will find in 
his text-book on the subject is omitted. 

Each case is preceded by a concise statement of the principle 
decided, and is" occasionally followed by an elucidatory note. 
In this way it has been possible to bring within the limits of a 
moderate-sized volume no less than 415 cases illustrative of 

a 2 



IV PREFACE. 

every branch of the law which the student has to take up for 
the purposes of his examinations. 

The idea is to afford a companion volume to whichever text- 
book he may happen to be studying on any particular subject, 
so that he may be able to turn to this book for a sufficiently full 
statement of the principal cases referred to in the text-book. 
It is hoped also that the work will be found specially useful for 
the purposes of revision, as containing in a small space all the 
cardinal propositions of law with an appropriate illustration of 
each one. It is believed that practically no case among those 
usually labelled and recognised as "leading" has been omitted, 
and a number of others will be found whose inclusion is con- 
sidered to be justified by reason of their aptness as illustrations 
of the principles underlying their decision. 

Since this Book has been printed the case of Yonge v. Toi/nbce, 
which in effect overrules the decision in Smout v. I/bery, has 
been reported. The facts and decision are set out in the Corri- 
gendum et Addendum on page xxxv. 

My grateful thanks are due to the general editor, Mr. 
Bertram Jacobs, LL.B., who is responsible for the scheme of 
the book, for the invaluable assistance he has so freely rendered. 

I also desire to express my sincere thanks to Mr. II. Trill, B.A. 
and LL.B. (Camb.) and B.A. (Cape), and Mr. D. H. J. 
Hartley, M.A. (Camb.), for their kind assistance in reading 
proofs and for many valuable suggestions made.

CORRIGENDUM ET ADDENDUM. 



YOXGE v. TOYNBEE. [1909] 
(79 L. J. K. B. 208; 102 L. T. 57.) 

Since the decision in Yonge v. Toynhee the law laid down in 
Srnout v. Ilbery (p. 141, infra), can no longer be relied on. 
In Yonge v. Toynhee it was held that there is no distinction 
between an agent's liability upon a warranty of authority in 
cases where he had no authority originally, and where he had 
such authority originally, but that authority has ceased. If he 
continues to act as agent in ignorance of the fact that his 
authority has ceased, he is liable upon warranty of authority. 

The facts and decision in that case were shortly as follows : — 

Before the commencement of the action the defendant had 
instructed a firm of solicitors to act for him, and had subse- 
quently become of unsound mind. After the issue of the writ 
the solicitors had, not knowing that the defendant had become 
of unsound mind and acting on the original instructions, entered 
an appearance for the defendant, and pleadings were delivered 
and various interlocutory steps were taken in the action. After 
notice of trial had been given, the solicitors for the first time 
discovered that the defendant had become of unsound mind, 
and they immediately informed the plaintiff. The plaintiff 

c 2 



XXXVI CORRIGENDUM ET ADDENDUM. 

took out a summons for an order that the appearance, and all 
subsequent proceedings in the action, should be struck out, and 
that the solicitors should pay the plaintiff's costs of the action. 

Held by the 0. A., doubting Smout v. Ilbery, that the 
plaintiff was entitled to an order that the solicitors should 
pay the plaintiffs costs, on the ground that a person 
tvho professes to act as agent impliedly contracts that 
he has authority, and is liable for a breach of that im- 
plied contract, even though the facts arc that he originally 
had authority, but that his authority has come to an end 
by reason of facts of -which he has no knowledge or means 
of knowledge.

or Conduct. 

THE SATANITA— DUNEAVEN v. CLAEKE. [1897] 
(66 L. J. Adm. 1; (1897) A. C. 59; 75 L. T. 337; 8 Asp. M. C. 190.) 

This action was brought by Lord Dunraven, the owner, and 
the master and crew of the yacht Valkyrie, against the owner 
of the yacht Sat a nit a, to recover damages in respect of a collision 
between the two yachts, which resulted in the sinking of the 
Valkyrie. The collision occurred whilst the yachts were pre- 
paring to take part in a race at the regatta of the Mudhook 
Yacht Club, for which they had both entered. The plaintiff, 
amongst other charges, alleged that the Satan ita, a yacht close- 
hauled on the port tack, was bound to keep out of the way of 
the Valkyrie, a yacht close-hauled on the starboard tack, under 
the 1 8th sailing rule of the Yacht Racing Association, and that 
the Satan it a disobeyed this rule. The defendant admitted that 
the yachts were entered for the race, which was advertised to 
be sailed under the Yacht Racing Association's rules, but 
denied that he and the plaintiff had respectively agreed to be 
bound by such rules. For the purposes of the action the defen- 
dant admitted that the collision was caused by the navigation 
of the Satanita in a manner improper, and constituting a breach 
of the rules, but alleged that such collision occurred without his

actual fault or privity, paid into Court the sum of 952/. 7s. 4d., 
Loin"' S/. a Ion on tlio registered tonnage of the Satanita, 

D DO* 

together with interest thereon, and claimed that by virtue of 
sect. 54 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1862, his liability was 
limited to that amount. At the time of the collision the yachts 
were about to start, and had become amenable to the rules of 
the Association. By rule 32 : " Any yacht disobeying or 
infringing any of these rules, which shall apply to all yachts, 
whether sailing in the same or different races, shall be dis- 
qualified from receiving any prize she would otherwise have 
won, and her owner shall hi- liable for all damages arising there- 
from." The question was whether the appellant was liable for 
the full value of the Valkyrie '7,500/.) under rule 32 above, or 
for the amount prescribed by sect. 54 of the Merchant Shipping 
Act, 1862. 

Held, inter alia, that the fact of the plaintiff ancl defen- 
dant entering for the race, and agreeing to be bound by the 
name rules, constituted a tacit contract between them which 
made them bound to each other in respect of rule 32, and 
that therefore the defendant's liability was not limited by 
sect. 64 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1862, to 81. per 
ton, but that he must wake good the whole value of the 
yacht. 



An Offer is Inoperative unless and until it is communicated to the 

Offeree. 

TAYLOE v. LAIED. [1856] 
(25 L. J. Ex. 329 ; 1 H. &amp; N. 266.) 

At the trial at Guildhall, before the Lord Chief Baron, at 
the sittings after Hilary Term, it appeared that the defendant 
had written to the plaintiff, offering to engage him for the 
command of a steamer destined for an exploring and trading 



OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE. 3 

voyage up the Hirer Niger, paying him at the rate of 50/. a 
month, commencing from a fixed date — the 1st December, 1854, 
— and also 20/. per cent, on the proceeds of the trade. The 
plaintiff replied in writing that he accepted the proposal, " to 
be paid 50/. a month and 20/. per cent, on the net proceeds of 
the trade," and on the other terms mentioned in the defendant's 
letter. The plaintiff received 50/. a month for several months 
before the voyage commenced, and afterwards proceeded in 
command of the vessel. In the course of the voyage up the 
river, and before the trading part of it commenced, disputes 
having arisen between the plaintiff and one of the gentlemen 
sent out with him to conduct the exploring and trading business 
of the expedition, the plaintiff in August (the ninth month from 
his retainer] relinquished to that gentleman "the navigation 
and social management " of the vessel; and from that time until 
the end of the voyage it did not appear that he took any actual 
part in the navigation or social management, although he pro- 
fessed at the time his readiness to lend every assistance, and 
co-operated in the trading. When the vessel on her return 
reached Fernando Po he discharged a native crew who had 
been engaged for the navigation of the Niger, landed different 
portions of the cargo, engaged the sailors to complete the crew, 
ordered repairs to be done to the ship, and went home in her to 
Limerick. There was no evidence that he had actually con- 
ducted the navigation of the vessel to Limerick ; but when she 
reached that port he received a letter from the defendant (who 
had previously heard of the plaintiff's relinquishment of the 
actual command) desiring him to discharge the crew, &amp;c. The 
plaintiff had received seven months' salary, and had entered on 
the ninth month when he gave up the command. 

Held, that the plaintiff was out// entitled to wages for the 
first eight months for which he had served, as he had himself 
put an end to the contract at the end of that time, for 
although, at the expiration of that period, he had continued 
to work for the defendant, yet no implied contract of service 

b 2 



CONTRACT. 



arose, for the defendant had no option to refuse the services 
rendered by the plaintiffs as they were performed without 
his knowledge. 



An Offer must be intended to create Legal Relations. 

MONTREAL GAS CO. v. VASEY. [1900] 
(69 L. J. P. C. 134 ; (1900) A. C. 595 ; 83 L. T. 233.) 

On December loth, 1886, the company entered into a contract 
with Vasey for the sale to him of ammoniacal liquor produced 
by them in their manufacture of gas, by the terms of which the 
company agreed to deliver to Vasey during a period of five 
years from May 1, 1887, all the ammoniacal liquor they should 
manufacture at their works. On December 20, 1886, five days 
after the execution of the contract, the president of the company 
wrote to Vasey the following letter : — 

" Referring to the contract made with you on the 15th inst., 
for the sale of ammoniacal liquor, I may say that, if we are 
satisfied with you as a customer, we would favourably consider 
an application from you, at the expiration of the term, for a 
renewal of the same for another period." 

At the expiration of the contract of December 15, the company 
refused Vasey's application for a renewal. Vasey thereupon 
brought his action against the company, seeking to recover 
damages for alleged breaches of the contract of December 15, 
1886, and also for the refusal to renew the original contract, 
which, as Vasey alleged, they were bound to do according to 
the terms of the letter of December 20. 

Held, that the letter did not constitute a contract or 
agreement susceptible of legal enforcement. 



OFFER ANJ) ACCEPTANCE. 



An Offer must be sufficiently definite, i.e., it must not be vague 

or illusory. 

DA VIES v. DA VIES. [1887] 
(56 L. J. Ob. 962 ; 36 Ob. D. 359 ; 58 L. T. 209 ; 36 W. E. 86.) 

Previously to the 15th of July, 1884, the plaintiff, Edward 
Albert Davies, and the defendant, James Davies, carried on 
business at Wolverhampton and in London in partnership with 
their father, Edward Davies, as galvanizers and galvanized iron 
manufacturers. Disputes between the partners, which were the 
subject of an action in the Chancery Division, were compromised 
by agreement dated the 15th of July, 1884, on the terms of the 
defendant, James Davies, retiring from the firm, he receiving a 
large sum in payment for his share of capital and goodwill, and 
entering into a covenant in the following terms : " The said 
James Davies to retire wholly and absolutely from the partner- 
ship, and, so far as the hue allows, from the trade or business 
thereof in all its branches, and not to trade, act, or deal in any 
way so as to either directly or indirectly affect the said Edward 
Davies and Edward Albert Davies." That provision was after- 
wards embodied in a deed dated the 11th of October, 1884, 
which was executed by the parties. The father, Edward Davies, 
died in the year 1885, and his interest in the old firm vested 
in the plaintiff, Edward Albert Davies, who assigned the busi- 
ness to the plaintiff company, Davies Bros. &amp; Co. 

By the present action the plaintiff, Edward Albert Davies, 
and the company claimed an injunction to restrain the defendant 
from directly or indirectly carrying on the business of a gal- 
vanizer, or galvanized iron manufacturer or merchant, in 
Middlesex or otherwise, so as to violate the covenant. 

Held, that that branch of the covenant, that A. would, 
11 so far as the law alloivs^ retire from the business of the 
partnership in all its branches, was too vague to be enforced. 

Note. — It was also held that that branch of the covenant, that 



6 CONTRACT. 

James Davies would not trade, &amp;c. so as to affect Edward Davies 
and Edward Albert Davies, was a covenant personally with the 
latter, and that the benefit of it could not be assigned to the 
plaintiff company. 



Offeror must give reasonable notice of Conditions. Conditions 
printed on a Passenger's Ticket are not binding until he has 
received reasonable notice of them. 

EICHAEDSON AND OTHEES v. EOWNTEEE. [1894] 

(63 L. J. Q. B. 283 ; (1894) A. C. 217 ; 6 E. 95 ; 70 L. T. 817 ; 
58 J. P. 493; 7 Asp. M. C. 482— H. L. (E.).) 

Miss Rowntree took a ticket for a voyage from Philadelphia 
to Liverpool by the S.S. Lord Goi/gh, and went on board. 
Owing to the negligence of the defendants in not properly 
fencing the gangway she fell into the sea whilst the steamer was 
still alongside the quay. On the plaintiff bringing an action 
against the defendants, they sought to limit their liability to 
10U dollars on the ground that one of the conditions printed on 
the ticket stated that the company would not be liable for 
injury to person, or loss to or injury to luggage, to an amount 
exceeding 100 dollars. Over this condition, or a portion of it ; 
however, was stamped in red ink the words, " American Line, 
Lord Goitgh, October 2, 1889. Peter Wright &amp; Sons, Gr. a., 
Philadelphia," which rendered the conditions difficult to read. 

Held, that the plaintiff was entitled to the amount of 
damages found by the jury , as, although the plaintiff knew 
that I here was some printing on the ticket, she did not know 
they were conditions relating to the terms of the contract of 
carriage, and the defendants had not done what ivas reason- 
ably sufficient to give the plaintiff notice of the conditions. 



OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE. 



An Offer may be Revoked before Acceptance even if it is to 
Remain Open for a Fixed Time which, has not Expired at 
the Time of Revocation. 

EOUTLEDGE v. GEANT. [1828] 

(6 L. J. (0. S.) C. P. 166 ; 4 Bing. 653 ; 1 M. &amp; P. 717 ; 3 Oar. &amp; P. 
267 ; 2&lt;J R. E. 672.) 

At the trial, before the Lord Chief Justice, at Guildhall, it 
appeared that the plaintiff held a house in St. James' Street, 
under a lease from a Mr. Hermon (who was seised in fee), for a 
term of which about twelve years were unexpired at Lady Day, 
1825; that the defendant, being desirous of taking a lease of 
the premises for an extended term, after several previous con- 
versations with the plaintiff on the subject, on the 18th March, 
1825, sent him the following written proposal : — 

" Mr. Grant's Proposal. 
" To pay a premium of 2,750/. upon receiving a lease for 
twenty-one years, with tbe option (upon giving six months' 
previous notice to the landlord or his agent) of having the time 
extended to thirty-one years, paying the same yearly rent as 
before for such extended term of ten years beyond twenty-one 
years. Rent, 25l)/., Mr. Grant to pay for the fixtures at a 
valuation. Possession to be given on or before the 25th July 
next, to which time all taxes and outgoings are to be dis- 
charged by Mr. Routledge, and a definite answer to be given 
within six weeks from the 18tb March, 1825." 

The plaintiff applied to Mr. Hermon, his landlord, for an 
extension of his term, in order to enable him to grant the lease 
to the defendant as before proposed, and wrote the following 
note to the defendant on the 6th April : — 

" Mr. Routledge begs to say that he accepts Mr. Grant's 
offer for his house, No. 59, St. James' Street, and that he will 
give Mr. Grant possession on the 1st of August next. 



8 CONTRACT. 

" Mr. Routledge will esteem it a particular favour if Mr. 
Grant will not, for the present, name the subject to anyone." 

Before the expiration of the six weeks mentioned in the 
defendant's offer he withdrew it, and the plaintiff then wrote to 
him again, stating that he was willing to give him possession 
according to the terms of his proposal. 

Held, that as the plaintiff had not accepted the defen- 
dant'' 's offer in terms before the latter had retracted it, the 
agreement was not completed and the defendant was at 
liberty to renounce it. 

If a party make an offer and fixes a period within which 
it is to be accepted or rejected by the person to ivliom it is 
made, though the latter may at any time within the 
stipulated 'period accept the offer, still the former may also 
at any time before it is accepted, retract it ; for to be valid 
the contract must be mutual: both or neither of the parties 
must be bound by it. 

Note. — But, semble, so long as eonmiunication of the revocation 
of the offer is received hefure acceptance, it need not come from the 
offeror or his agent. It may come, for instance, through a third 
party, so long as it be credible. The foregoing, it is submitted, is 
the effect of Dickinson v. Dodds (1876), 45 L. J. Ch. 777 ; 2 Ch. D. 
463 ; 34 L. T. 607 ; 24 W. E. 594. 



The Revocation of an Offer, in order to be operative, must be 
communicated to the Offeree. 

BYENE v. VAN TIENHOVEN. [1880] 
(49 L. J. C. E. 316 ; 5 C. P. D. 344 ; 42 L. T. 371 ; -14 J. P. 667.) 

The defendants carried on business at Cardiff and the plaintiffs 
at New York, and it took ten or eleven days for a letter posted 
at either place to reach the other. The alleged contract con- 



OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE. 9 

sisted of a letter written by the defendants to the plaintiffs on 
the 1st October, 1879, and received by them on the 11th, and 
accepted by telegram and letter sent to the defendants on the 
11th and 15th October respectively. The letter and telegram 
were as follows : — 

" From Leon Van Tienhoven &amp; Co., Cardiff, to Messrs. Joseph 
Byrne &amp; Co., New York, posted October, 1st, 1879. 

" We are duly in receipt of your favour of the 18th ulto., and 
are glad to hear you admit our prices for tin-plates to be 

moderate As you say that Hensol is a favourite brand 

of yours, we will .... maintain our firm offer of 1,000 boxes 
of this brand, 14 by 20 at 17s. &lt;6d. per box f.o.b. here, with one 
per cent, for our commission, terms four months' bankers' 
acceptance on London or Liverpool against shipping documents, 
but subject to your cable on or before the 15th inst. here. . . ." 

Cablegram from Messrs. Joseph Byrne &amp; Co., New York, to 
Messrs. Leon Van Tienhoven &amp; Co., Cardiff, sent October 11th, 
1879 :— 

" Accept thousand Hensol." 

On the 8th of October the defendants wrote, and sent by post 
to the plaintiffs, a letter withdrawing their offer of the 1st. 
The following is the material part of such letter : — 

" Confirming our respects of the 1st inst., we hasten to inform 
you that, there having been a regular panic in the tin-plate 
market during the last few days, which has caused prices to run 
up about twenty-five per cent., we are reluctantly compelled to 
withdraw any offer we have made to our constituents, and must 
therefore also consider our offer to you for 1,000 boxes of 
' Hensols' at 17s. &lt;6d. to be cancelled from this date." 

This letter of the 8th of October did not reach the plaintiffs 
until the 20th of October, i.e., some days after the plaintiffs 
had cabled their acceptance, although it was posted some days 
before. The plaintiffs now sued the defendants for damages for 
non-delivery of the tin-plates. 

Held j that though an offer of sale may be withdrawn 



Id contract. 

before it has been accepted, the withdrawal must be commu- 
nicated to the party to whom ihe offer has been made before 
such acceptance. In particular, where an offer of sale is 

mode and accepted by letters sent through the post, the 
withdrawal takes effect only when the letter containing it 
has been received, and not from the moment it is posted, 
unless the part// to ivhom the offer is made has given the 
other authority to notify his withdrawal by letter so posted. 



An Offer must be distinguished from a mere Statement of Fact. 

HARVEY AND ANOTHER v. EACEY. [1893] 

(62 L. J. P. C. 127 ; (1893) A. C. 552 ; 1 R. 428 ; 69 L. T. 504 ; 
42 W. R. 129.) 

The appellants were solicitors carrying on business in partner- 
ship at Kingston. In the beginning of October, 1891, negotia- 
tions took place between the respondent, L. M. Facey, and the 
Mayor and Council of Kingston for the sale of property known 
as Bumper Hall Pen, and Facey offered to sell it to them for the 
sum of 900/. The offer was discussed b}^ the Council at then- 
meetin°' on the 6th of October, 1891, and the consideration of 
its acceptance deferred. On the 7th of October, 1891, L. M. 
Facey was travelling in the train from Kingston to Porus, and 
the appellants caused a telegram to be sent after him from 
Kingston, addressed to him " On the train for Porus," in the 
following words : kt Will you sell us Bumper Hall Pen ? Tele- 
graph lowest cash price-— answer paid." On the same day 
L. M. Facey replied by telegram to the appellants in the 
following words : " Lowest price for Bumper Hall Pen 900/." 
On the same day the appellants replied to the last-mentioned 
telegram by a telegram addressed to L. M. Facey " On train at 
Porus," in the words following : "We agree to buy Bumper 
Hall Pen for the sum of nine hundred pounds asked by you. 
Please send us your title deed in order that we may get early 



OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE. 1 1 

possession." The above telegrams were duly received by the 
appellants and by L. M. Facey respectively, and the question 
was whether they constituted a contract between the respondent 
and the appellants, binding the former to sell Bumper Hall Pen 
to the latter. 

Held, that they did not constitute a binding contract, the 
Court being of opinion that the mere statement of the lowest 
price at which the vendor would sell contained no implied 
contract to sell at that price to the persons making the inquiry. 



An Offer must be distinguished from a mere Statement of 
Intention. 

IN EE FICKUS— FAKINA v. FICKUS. [1900] 
(69 L. J. Ch. 161 ; (1900) 1 Ch. 331 ; 81 L. T. 749 ; 48 W. E. 250.) 

Mr. and Mrs. Farina brought an action against the executors 
of Mr. William Fickus, claiming for a declaration that a letter 
written by the testator shortly before the marriage of the 
plaintiffs constituted a binding contract for valuable considera- 
tion to give or leave to Mrs. Farina, who was one of the 
testator's daughters, iu the events which had happened, one 
equal one-eighth share of his net property. In September, 
1873, Mr. Farina, a German subject resident at Cologne, made 
a proposal of marriage to Miss Eliza Fickus, which she 
accepted subject to the approval and consent of her father, the 
ttstator. Mr. Farina wrote to the testator a letter, which was 
not forthcoming at the trial, and the testator replied on 
September 21st, 1873. This letter had been kept by Mr. Farina, 
and was the one upon which the action was based, and which, 
so far as is material, was as follows : — 

" You are, of course, aware that, with my large family, Eliza 
will have little fortune. She will have a share of what I have 
after the death of her mother, whom I wish to leave in 
comfortable independence if I should leave her a widow." 



12 CONTRACT. 

The marriage afterwards took place. The testator died in 
1898, having acquired a considerable fortune since 1874. By 
his will, after numerous pecuniary legacies, including a legacy 
of 2,000/. to Mrs. Farina and a legacy of 1,000/. to her son, 
the testator bequeathed the residue of his estate equally between 
six of his other seven children. The net value of the testator's 
estate was valued by his executors at 102,000/. The plaintiffs 
by their action claimed to be entitled by virtue of the letter of 
September 21st to a sum equal to one-eighth of the net value 
of the testator's estate, after giving credit for the 2,000/. 
legacy. 

Held ^ inter alia, that the letter did not amount to a 
contract by the testator to leave his daughter a share of his 
property, but was merely a representation that lie intended 
to give her something at his death. 

Note. — It was further held that, even assuming that the letter 
did constitute a contract, the words "a share" were not equivalent 
to "an equal share," and that therefore the contract was satisfied 
by the legacy to the daughter of the 2,000/. 



An Invitation to Treat or to Make an Offer is not an Offer. 

SPENCER AND OTHERS v. HARDING AND OTHERS. [1870] 
(39 L. J. C. P. 332 ; L. R. 5 C. P. 561 ; 23 L. T. 237 ; 19 W. R. 48.) 

The defendants by their agents, Messrs. Honey, Humphreys 
&amp; Co., issued to the plaintiffs and other persons engaged in the 
wholesale trade a circular as follows : — 

•• We are instructed to offer to the wholesale trade for sale by 
tender the stock-in-trade of Messrs. George Eilbeck &amp; Co., of 
I, Milk Street, amounting as per stock book to 2,503/. 13a. Id., 
and which will hp sold at a discount in one lot. Payment to 
be made in cash. The stock may be viewed on the premises, 



OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE. 13 

No. 1, Milk Street, up to Thursday, 20th inst., on which day at 
12 o'clock at noon precisely the tenders will be received and 
opened at our offices. Should you tender and not attend the 
sale, please address to us sealed and endorsed ' Tender for 
Eilbeck's Stock.' Stock books may be had at our offices on 
Tuesday morning." 

The plaintiffs sent in a tender for the goods in accordance 
with the circular. The tender of the plaintiffs was the highest 
received. The plaintiffs' claim proceeded : — " The plaintiffs 
were ready and willing to pay for the said goods according to 
the true intent and meaning of the said circular, and all 
conditions were performed and all things were done and all 
times elapsed necessary to entitle the plaintiffs to have their 
said tender accepted by the defendants, and to be declared 
the purchasers of the said goods according to the true intent 
and meaning of the said circular. Yet the defendants refused 
to accept the said tender of the plaintiffs, and refused to sell the 
said goods to the plaintiffs, and refused to open the said tender, 
or proceed with the sale of the said goods in accordance with 
their said offer and undertaking in that behalf. Whereby the 
plaintiffs have been deprived of the profits which would have 
accrued to them from the acceptance of their said tender, and 
the delivery to them of the said goods in accordance with the 
said offer and undertaking of the defendants." 

Held, that the circular was only an invitation for offers, 
and that there was no implied undertaking by the defendants 
to accept any tender at all. 

Note. — Mention may here be made of Rooke v. Bauson, 64 L. J. 
Ch. 301 ; [1895] 1 Ch. 408 ; 72 L. T. 248 ; 43 W. E. 313 ; 59 J. P. 
231 ; 13 R. 269, where it was held that the mere announcement by 
the trustees of a scholarship that an examination for the same will 
be held does not amount to an offer to award the scholarship to the 
candidate who obtains the highest number of marks, and that in 
such case an action by such candidate against the trustees must 
take the form, not of an action to enforce a contract, but of an 
action to enforce the trusts of the charity. The Court purported to 



14 CONTRACT. 

follow Spencer v. Hardin//, but the case seems equally, and iu&lt;l&lt; ed 
rather more, within the principle of Montreal Gas Co. v. I'asey or 
In re Fichus. (See supra.) 



An Offer made to the World at Large is deemed to be communicated 
to each Person whom it reaches. 

CAELILL v. CAKBOLIC SMOKE BALL CO. [1893] 

(62 L. J. Q. B. 257 ; (1893) 1 Q. B. 256 ; 4 R. 176 ; 67 L. T. 837 ; 
41 W. R. 210; 57 J. P. 325.) 

The defendants in November, 1891, caused to be published 
in several newspapers an advertisement to the following effect : 

" 100/. reward, will be paid, by the Carbolic Smoke Ball 
Company to any person who contracts the increasing epidemic 
influenza, colds or any disease caused by taking cold, after 
having used, the ball three times daily for two weeks according 
to the printed, directions supplied with each ball. 1,000/. is 
deposited with the Alliance Bank, Regent Street, showing our 
sincerity in the matter." 

The plaintiff, relying upon the advertisement, bought from a 
chemist one of the smoke balls, and contracted influenza after 
using the ball for two weeks in accordance with the printed 
directions. She then claimed the 100/., and on the defendants 
refusing to pay, brought this action to recover the amount. 

//'•A/, fli'if the advertisement, coupled with the performance 
of the condition by the plaintiffs constituted a contract on 
the part of the defendants to pay the plaintiff 100/. 

Note. — It was also held that the offer was not too vague to be 
enforced, that it was not a mere puff, that it was not of a wagering' 
character, and that it was not a policy of insurance. 



OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE. 15 

Once accepted, an Offer cannot be revoked. 

G. N. EAILWAY CO. v. W1THAM. [1873] 
(43 L. J. C. P. 11 ; L. R. 9 C. P. 16 ; 29 L. T. 471 ; 22 W. R. 48.) 

The plaintiffs advertised for tenders for the supply of iron, 
and the defendant offered in writing 1 to sell to the plaintiffs iron 
upon certain terms. The material portions of the defendant's 
tender were as follows : — 

" I, the undersigned, hereby undertake to supply the Great 
Northern Railway Company for twelve mouths with such 
quantities of each or any of the several articles named in the 
attached specification as the company's storekeeper may order 
from time to time, at the price set opposite each article 
respectively, and agree to abide by the conditions stated on the 
other side." 

The defendant's tender was accepted in the following letter, 
addressed to the defendant by the assistant secretary to the 
plaintiffs' company : — 

" I am instructed to inform you that my directors have 
accepted your tender to supply to this company, at Doncaster 
Station, any quantity they may order during the period ending 
31st October, 1872, of the descriptions of iron mentioned on the 
enclosed list, at the prices specified therein. The terms of the 
contract must be strictly adhered to." 

The defendant, in reply, wrote as follows : — 

" I beg to own receipt of your favour accepting my tender 
for bars, for which I am obliged. Your specification shall 
receive my best attention." 

The plaintiffs ordered iron from the defendant, which the 
defendant failed to deliver, and this action was brought to 
recover damages for breach of contract. The defendant pleaded 
that the alleged contract did not bind the plaintiff to order any 
iron from the defendant, that there was, therefore, no mutuality, 



16 CONTRACT. 

and the contract, being unilateral, was void as against the 
defendant. 

Held, that the contract was not void for tvant of 
mutuality^ it was founded upon a good consideration, and 
the plaintiffs were entitled to judgment. 

The defendant' 's promise being to supply such iron as the 
plaintiff should from time to time order, when an order 
was given by the plaintiffs there was then a consideration 
for the defendant's promise and a contract formed. 



In a Sale by Auction without reserve the Auctioneer contracts

Auctioneer may not accept Bid from Owner of Goods. 

If Auctioneer without authority undertakes to sell without 
Reserve, he is liable on his Undertaking. 

WAELOW v. HAEEISON. [1858] 

(29 L. J. Q. B. 14 ; 1 El. &amp; El. 295 ; 6 Jur. (N. S.) 66 ; 
8 W. E. 95.) 

The defendant, who was an auctioneer, advertised the sale of 
a mare called " Janet Pride " to be made without reserve. The 
plaintiff attended the sale, and bid 60 guineas for her, and 
thereupon Mr. Henderson, the owner of the mare, bid 61 guineas. 
The plaintiff, having been informed that Henderson was the 
owner, declined to bid further, and thereupon the defendant 
knocked down the mare to Henderson for 61 guineas. The 
same day the plaintiff tendered 63/. in sovereigns as the price 
of the mare and demanded her. The defendant refused the 
tender. 

Held, the plaintiff ?vas entitled to judgment. Where a 
sale is announced to be without reserve, the auctioneer 



OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE. 17 

pledges himself that the sale shall he without reserve, or, in 
other words, contracts that it shall be so ; and this contract 
is made with the highest bona fide bidder, and in case of a 
breach of it the latter has a right of action against the 
auctioneer. 

If an auctioneer, not having authority from the owner to 
sell property ivithout reserve, undertakes to sell it without 
reserve, he is liable on his undertaking. 



If the Offeror does not indicate the Method of Acceptance, it 
is that prescribed by Usage. 

HENTHORN v. FRASER. [1892] 
(61 L. J. Ch. 373 ; (1892) 2 Ch. 27 ; 66 L. T. 439 ; 40 W. R. 433.) 

The action was brought against the trustees of the Huskisson 
Benefit Building Society and the society for the specific per- 
formance of a contract to sell to the plaintiff certain house 
property situate in Flamank Street, Birkenhead. 

On the 7th July, 1891, the secretary of the society handed to 
the plaintiff, in the office of the society at Liverpool, a letter in 
these terms : "I hereby give you the refusal of the Flamank 
Street property, at 750/., for fourteen days." The plaintiff had 
been for some time in negotiation for the property, and had on 
two previous occasions made offers for the purchase of it, which 
were not accepted by the society. These offers were made by 
means of letters written by the secretary in the office of the 
society, and signed by the plaintiff there. The plaintiff was 
unable to write except to sign his name. The plaintiff resided 
in Birkenhead, and he took away with him to that town the 
letter of the 7th of July, containing the offer of the society. On 
the 8th of July a letter was posted in Birkenhead at 3.50 p.m., 
written by his solicitor, accepting on his behalf the offer to sell 
the property at 750/. This letter was not received at the defen- 
dant's office until 8.30 p.m., after office hours, the office being 

J. c 



18 CONTRACT. 

closed at six o'clock. On the same day a letter had been 
addressed to the plaintiff by the secretary of the building society 
in these terms : " Please take notice that my letter of the 
7th inst., giving you the option of purchasing the property at 
Flamank Street, Birkenhead, at 750/., for fourteen days, is 
withdrawn, and the offer cancelled." This letter was posted 
in Liverpool between 12 and 1 p.m., and was received in 
Birkenhead at 5.30 p.m. Consequently, it was received before 
the plaintiff's letter of acceptance had reached Liverpool, but 
after it had been posted. 

Held, that the acceptance was complete before the offer 
ivas withdrawn. Where an offer is made under such circum- 
stances that it must have been within the contemplation of 
the parties that, according to the ordinary usages of man- 
kind, the post might be used as a means of communication, 
the acceptance is complete as soon as it is posted ; but this 
doctrine does not apply to the revocation or modification of 
an offer, for this can be no more effectual than the. offer 
itself, unless brought to the mind of the person to whom the 
offer is made. 



The Mode of Acceptance must be that, if any, indicated by the 

Offeror. 

ELIASON v. HENSHAW. [1819] 
(4 Wheaton (U. S.) 225.) 

Eliason offered to purchase from Henshaw two or three 
hundred barrels of flour, to be delivered at Georgetown (Dis- 
trict of Columbia) by the first water, and to pay for the same 
9 dollars and 50 cents per barrel. Eliason asked for a reply to 
this offer by the return of the wagon by which the letter was 
sent. This wagon was at that time in the service of Henshaw, 
and employed by him in conveying flour from his mill to 



OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE. 19 

Harper's Ferry, near to which place Eliason then was. The 
offer was accepted by Henshaw in a letter sent by the first 
regular mail to Georgetown, and received by Eliason at that 
place ; but no answer was ever sent to Harper's Ferry. 

Held, that this acceptance, communicated at a place 
different from that indicated by Eliason, imposed no obliga- 
tion binding upon him. 

An offer of a bargain by one person to another imposes 
no obligation upon the former unless it is accepted by the 
latter according to the terms in which the offer was made. 
Any qualification of, or departure from, those terms 
invalidates the offer, unless the same be agreed to by the 
party who made it. 



The doing of an Act indicating that the Offeree has made up his 
mind to Accept is not necessarily Acceptance. 

. FELTHOUSE v. BINDLEY. [1862] 

(31 L. J. 0. P. 204; 7 L. T. 835; 11 W. E. 429; 
11 C. B. (N. 8.) 869.) 

At the trial it appeared that the defendant was an auctioneer 
and the plaintiff a builder in London. Late in the year 1860 
John Felthouse, a nephew of the plaintiff, was about to sell his 
farming stock, and a conversation took place between the plaintiff 
and his nephew as to the purchase by the former of one of the 
nephew's horses, the result of which appears from the following- 
correspondence. 

On the 1st January, 1861, the nephew wrote to the plaintiff 
as follows : — 

" Dear Sir, — I saw father on Saturday. He told me that 
you considered you had bought the horse for 30/. If so, you 
are labouring under a mistake, for thirty guineas was the price 

c2 



20 CONTRACT. 

I put upon hira, and you never heard me say less. When you 
said you would have him I considered you were aware of the 
price, as I would not take less. 

(Signed) "J. Felthouse." 

To this the plaintiff replied on the following day as follows : — 

" Dear Nephew, — Your price, I admit, was 30 guineas. I 
offered 30/. — never offered more — and you said the horse was 
mine. However, as there may be a mistake about him, I will 
split the difference — : 30/. 15s., I paying all expenses from Tarn- 
worth. You can send him at your convenience between now 
and the 25th of March. If I hear no more about him I con- 
sider the horse is mine at 301. 15s. 

(Signed) " Paul Felthouse." 

No reply was sent by the nephew to this letter. 

On the 21st of February the nephew's stock was sold by 
auction by the defendant, when the horse in question was sold 
by a mistake of the defendant with the rest of the stock. 

On the 22nd February the defendant wrote to the plaintiff as 
follows : — 

" Dear Sir, — I am sorry I am obliged to acknowledge 
myself forgetful in the matter of one of Mr. J. Felthouse's 
horses. Instructions were given me to reserve the horse, but 
the lapse of time and a multiplicity of business pressing upon 
me caused me to forget my previous promise. I hope you will 
not experience any great inconvenience. I will do all I can to 
get the horse again, but shall know on Saturday if I have 
succeeded. 

(Signed) " Wm. Bindley." 

On the 27th of February the nephew wrote to the plaintiff 
as follows : — 

" My dear Uncle, — My sale took place on Monday last, and 
we are very much annoyed in one instance. When Mr. Bindley 
came over to take an inventory of the stock I said that horse 
(meaning the one sold to you) is sold. Mr. 13. said it would be 
better to put it in the sale, and he would buy it in without any 



OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE. 21 

charge. Father stood by whilst he was running it up, but had 
no idea but he was doing it for the good of the sale, and 
according to his previous arrangement, until he heard him call 
out Mr. Grlover. He then went to Mr. B. and said that horse 
was not to be sold. He exclaimed he had quite forgotten, but 
would see Mr. Grlover and try to recover it, and says he will 
give 51. to the gentleman if he will give it up, but we fear it 
doubtful." 

Held, in action by the plaintiff against the defendant for 
conversion of the horse, the defendant ivus entitled to judg- 
ment, as llif plaintiff had no title to the horse at the time of 
the auction, there having been no acceptance of the plaintiff 's 
offer before the auction ivhich tvas binding on the nepheiv. 
The direction to the auctioneer by the nepheiv before the 
auction to reserve the horse was simply an expression of his 
intention to accept the plaintiff's offer, and although the 
nepheiv 's letter of the 27th February to the plaintiff shows 
that the defendant had accepted the plaintiff's offer, yet 
the plaintiff could not rely upon this letter as it would not 
relate back so as to complete the plaintiff ' s title to the horse 
at the time of the auction. 



An Offer will lapse if not accepted within the time fixed for 
Acceptance, or, if no time be fixed for Acceptance, then 
within a reasonable time.

14 W. R. 335.) 

The company was completely registered on the 6th .June, 
1864, on which day the articles of association were duly 
registered. 



22 CONTRACT. 

Prior to the 8th June, 1864, the defendant had received one 
of the company's prospectuses containing this statement : 
" Deposit on application 1/. per share, and 4/. on allotment." 
On the 8th June the defendant paid to the company's bankers 
the sum of 50/., taking the printed receipt in the form attached 
to the prospectus for " 50/., being the deposit paid in accordance 
with the terms of the prospectus on an application for an allot- 
ment of fifty shares." On the same day he filled up and 
forwarded to the directors the printed application for shares, 
also attached to the prospectus, in the following form : — 

" To the Directors of the Ramsgate Victoria Hotel Company 
(Limited). 

" Grentlemen, — Having paid to your bankers the sum of 50/., 
I hereby request you will allot me fifty shares of 20/. each in 
the Ramsgate Victoria Hotel Company (Limited), and I hereby 
agree to accept such shares or any smaller number that may be 
allotted to me." 

Between the month of June and the 23rd of November the 
defendant received no direct communication from the directors 
or their secretary. 

On the same day the secretary prepared a third list of share- 
holders, including the defendant's name as a holder of fifty 
shares, and notice of it was sent to him in the following letter 
from the secretary : — 

" I am instructed by the directors to acquaint you that in 
compliance with your application they have allotted to you fifty 
shares in this company, and have entered your name in the 
register of shareholders for the same." 

The defendant's solicitor wrote declining the shares, and 
requiring the removal of the defendant's name from the list of 
shareholders, and a return of the deposit. 

Cross actions were then commenced, the company suing for 
the amount of the call, and damages for not accepting the 
shares ; the defendant suing for a return of the deposit. 

Held, the defendant teas entitled to the return of his 



OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE. g3 

deposit on the ground that there had been no allotment 
within a reasonable time after the application for the shares, 
and consequently the defendant was not bound. 



An Acceptance, otherwise sufficient, may be operative although 
it never reaches the Offeror. 

HOUSEHOLD FIRE INSURANCE CO. v. GRANT. [1879] 
(48 L. J. Ex. 577 ; 4 Ex. D. 216 ; 41 L. T. 298 ; 27 W. R, 858.) 

The plaintiff's sued for the amount of a call on certain shares 
in their company alleged to be held, by the defendant. The 
defendant denied that he was a shareholder. It appeared that 
the defendant duly applied by a letter in the usual form for 
100 shares in the plaintiff company on the 30th September, 
1874; that the shares were allotted to him, and a letter of 
allotment directed to him at the address given by him was 
posted on the 20th October, 1874. The defendant said that 
this letter of allotment never reached him, and that he never 
heard anything about the shares until March, 1877, when he 
received a letter demanding the payment of a call upon 100 
shares, which was the amount sought to be recovered in this action. 

The jury found that the letter of allotment of the 20th October, 
1874, had been posted, but that it had never been received by 
the defendant. 

Held, the defendant was liable, for the contract was 
complete directly the letter of allotment was posted, although 
it never reached the offeror. 



An Acceptance must be unqualified. 

JONES v. DANIEL. [1894] 

(63 L. J. Ch. 562 ; (1894) 2 Ch. 332 ; 8 R. 579 ; 70 L. T. 588 ; 

42 W. R. 687.) 

In April, 1893, the plaintiff, "W. Jones, being the owner in 
fee of certain land in Ely Road, Llandaff, subject to long 



24 CONTRACT. 

building leases, was negotiating by his agents and solicitors, 
Messrs. Lewis &amp; Jones, for the sale of the land. On the 26th 
of April, 1893, Messrs. Lewis &amp; Jones wrote as follows to 
the defendant : — 

"Merthyr Tydfil, 26th April, 1893. 

" Ely Road Property. 

" Dear Sir, — We wrote to Mr. David as we thought he acted 
for you in all matters ; but as this is not so, and you wish us 
to communicate with you direct, we now do so. Mr. W. Jones 
has considered your offer of 1,150/. for his reversionary interest 
in this property. He thinks it very low ; but as his state of 
health will not permit him to personally look after the property, 
and he does not like being worried by the differences between 
his lessees as to right of way, &amp;c, he accepts it, and we enclose 
contract for your signature. On receipt of this, signed by you 
across the stamp, and deposit, we will send you copy signed 
by him. The fees we referred to are those which you will 
see by your lease are payable on any assignment, mortgage, 
transfer, or disposition by the lessee, to amount of five shillings 
in each case. These, of course, vary according to circumstances. 
We think they ought to have been taken into consideration, and 
thus increase your offer 25/. or o0/. 

" Yours faithfully, 

" Lewis &amp; Jones." 

The " contract " enclosed provided for payment of deposit, 
completion on a certain date, limitations as to the title to be 
shown, and other matters not previously referred to in the 
correspondence. 

The plaintiff claimed specific performance of an agreement 
to purchase at 1,400/., on the footing that the correspondence 
contained a sufficient contract in writing. 

Helc^ the plaintiff } s case failed, as it was clear that 
there was no contract between the 'parties apart from the 
letters, which did not show a concluded agreement, as the 



OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE. 25 

letter of the 2tith April, purporting to accept the offer, 
enclosed for the purchaser ] s signature a formal document 
which contained material terms not mentioned in either 
letter, and requiring payment of a deposit. There was 
therefore not a sufficient note or memorandum to satisfy 
sect. 4 of the Statute of Frauds as a concluded agreement 
in writing enforceable at the suit of the vendor. 



A Qualified Acceptance is equivalent to a Refusal, and will cause 
the Offer to lapse. 

HYDE v. WEENCH. [1840] 
(3 Beav. 334 ; 4 Jur. 1106.) 

The defendant on the 6th of June offered, in writing, to sell 
his farm for 1,000/. ; but the plaintiff offered 950/., which the 
defendant, on the 27th of June, after consideration refused to 
accept. Two days later the plaintiff by letter agreed to the 
defendant's original offer of 1,000/. The defendant, however, 
although there had been no formal withdrawal of his original 
offer, now refused to sell. 

Held, there was no binding contract, for the plaintiff, by 
making an offer of his own to buy the property for 9501, 
had thereby rejected the offer previously made by the defen- 
dant, and that it was not afterwards competent for him to 
revive the proposal of the defendant by tendering an 
acceptance of it. 



26 CONTRACT. 



An Acceptance is not unqualified merely because to it are 
appended Remarks relating to Points arising" out of, but not 
actually forming- part of, the Bargain. 

SIMPSON v. HUGHES. [1897] 
(66 L. J. Oh. 334 ; 76 L. T. 237 ; 45 W. E. 221.) 

The defendant was the owner of a certain freehold house and 
land called the " Wray Estate." On the 7th of November, 
1895, his agent wrote on his behalf to the plaintiff asking 
whether he was disposed to purchase this estate at the price of 
2,000/. In answer to this the plaintiff wrote on the 8th Novem- 
ber, 1895, a letter, the material parts of which were as follows: 

" I . . . have decided to accept Mr. Hughes' offer, and will 
give you the 2,000/. he asks for the freehold of the Wray 
property. 

" I should like to know from what time Mr. Hughes wishes 
the purchase to date. . . . 

" You do not mention fences, but I should be obliged if they 
may be seen to at once, as they really need attention." 

No reply was made to this letter. 

The Wray Estate was in the occupation in part of Mr. Simp- 
son, and in part of Professor Armstrong, as tenants of 
Mr. Hughes. Both tenants had been for some time aware 
of Mr. Hughes' wish to sell, and had been negotiating as to a 
purchase ; and in September, 1895, Mr. Hughes' agent had 
written to Professor Armstrong offering him the Wray Estate 
upon terms similar to those contained in the offer to Mr. Simp- 
son. Professor Armstrong wrote accepting this offer on the 
12th of November, 1895. 

Both Mr. Simpson and Professor Armstrong brought actions 
against Hughes for specific performance of their contracts. 

Held, that Simpson was entitled to specific performance 

of the contract, as the letters of the 7th and Sth November 



OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE. 27 

constituted a binding agreement. There was nothing in 
Simpson's letter of the 8th November which detracted from 
the acceptance contained therein. 

The action by Professor Armstrong was dismissed. 



An Inquiry as to whether the Offeror will modify his Terms will 
not necessarily amount to a refusal so as to cause the Offer 
to lapse. 

STEVENSON v. McLEAN. [1880] 

(49 L. J. Q. B. 701 ; 5 Q. B. D. 346 ; 42 L. T. 897 ; 28 W. R. 916.) 

This was an action for non-delivery of a quantity of iron which 
it was alleged the defendant contracted to sell to the plaintiffs 
at 40s. per ton net cash. 

In reply to inquiries by the plaintiff, the defendant's broker, 
Mr. Fossick, wrote that the defendant was not inclined to make 
a firm offer to sell certain warrants for iron which he held. 

On the 29th September (Saturday), however, the defendant 
himself wrote to the plaintiff as follows : — 

" Mr. Fossick's clerk showed me a telegram from him yester- 
day mentioning 39s. for No. 3 as present price, 40s. for forward 
delivery. I instructed the clerk to wire you that I would now 
sell for 40s. net cash, open till Monday." 

No such telegram was sent by Fossick's clerk. 

The plaintiffs were thus on the 28th (Sunday) in possession 
of both letters, the one from Fossick stating that the defendant 
was not inclined to make a firm offer, and the other from the 
defendant himself to the effect that he would sell for 40s. net 
cash, and would hold it open all Monday. This, it was admitted, 
must have been the meaning of " open till Monday." 

On the Monday morning at 9 42 the plaintiffs telegraphed to 
the defendant, " Please wire whether you would accept forty for 
delivery over two months, or if not, longest limit you would give." 



28 CONTRACT. 

This telegram was received at the office at Moorgate at 
10.1 a.m. and was delivered at the defendant's office in the 
Old Jewry shortly afterwards. No answer to this telegram was 
sent by the defendant, hut after its receipt he sold the warrants 
through Fossick for 40s. net cash, and at 1.25 sent off a tele- 
gram to the plaintiffs, " Have sold all my warrants here for 
forty net to-day." This telegram reached Middlesboro' at 1.46, 
and was delivered in due course. 

Before its arrival at Middlesboro', however, and at 1.34, the 
plaintiffs telegraphed to defendant, " Have secured your price 
for payment next Monday, write you fully by post." 

By the usage of the iron market at Middlesboro', contracts 
made on a Monday for cash are payable on the following 
Monday. 

The principal objection relied on by the defendant was that 
the telegram sent by the plaintiffs on the Monday was a rejection 
of the defendant's offer, and a new proposal on the plaintiffs' 
part, and that the defendant had therefore a right to regard it 
as putting an end to the original negotiation. 

Held, that the plaintiffs were entitled to judgment. The 

telegram sent by them did not amount to a refusal so as to 

cause the offer to lapse, but was merely an inquiry as to 
whether the defendant would modify his terms. 

The defendants offer being a continuing one throughout 
Monday, the plaintiffs were authorized by it to sell at any 
time during the day until notice of its revocation reached 
them. The revocation having no effect until it was com- 
mu ideated, the plaintiffs were entitled to require delivery of 
the iron.

A Contract is deemed to be made at place where accepted. 

COWAN r. O'CONNOR. [1888] 

(57 L. J. Q. B. 401 ; 20 Q. B. 1). 640 ; 58 L. T. 857 ; 36 W. R. 895.) 

Plaintiff telegraphed from Regent Street to defendant in the 
City directing him to make bets, on his behalf, on certain 
horses. 

Defendant replied by telegram, " Yon are on." Upon plain- 
tiff suing defendant as his agent in the Mayor's Court for 356/. 
received to his use, defendant applied for a writ of prohibition, 
on the ground that that Court had no jurisdiction, as the whole 
cause of action did not arise within the City. 

Held, that the application must be refused since the 
whole cause of action arose within the City — the telegraph 
office being merely the medium through which the parlies 
were brought into communication — and they were accord- 
ingly in the same position as if they had met together in the 
City and made a contract. 



The publication of a Time-table constitutes a promise to run the 
advertised Trains, which, when accepted by an application 
for a Ticket, constitutes a Contract which may be sued upon 
if Train is not run or is late. 

DENTON v. GREAT NORTHERN RAILWAY CO. [1856] 

(25 L. J. Q. B. 129 ; 5 E. &amp; B. 860 ; 2 Jur. N. S. 185.) 

In the printed and published time-tables of the defendants 
for the month of March, 1805, which were kept in circulation 
throughout the month, a passenger train was advertised to leave 
the defendants' station in London at 5 p.m., and to arrive at 
Peterborough at about 7.20 the same evening, and about the 
same time to proceed on to Hull, arriving at Hull about mid- 
night. The time-tables contained a notice to the effect that the 
defendants would not hold themselves responsible for delay, or 



30 CONTRACT. 

the consequences arising therefrom, Relying on the time-tables, 
the plaintiff left London on the 25th of March for Peterborough 
on business, intending to go to Hull the same evening. He 
accordingly applied to the clerk at Peterborough station in 
proper time for a ticket by the train advertised to leave for 
Hull about 7.20 p.m., and offered to pay the fare ; the clerk, 
however, refused to grant the ticket, stating as a reason that 
the train only went as far as Milford Junction, and the North 
Eastern train which formerly took the passengers from Milford 
Junction to Hull had ceased to run. By reason of his inability 
to reach Hull that evening the plaintiff suffered pecuniary loss, 
and brought this action against the defendants. 

Held, that the publication of the time-tables amounted 
to a promise by the defendants that a train ivould leave 
Peterborough for Hull as advertised, for the conveyance 
of any person ivho regularly applied for a ticket and 
tendered the proper fare, although part of the line of rail- 
way belonged to a different company, and that the defendants 
therefore iv ere liable to the plaintiff for a breach of contract.

Where Goods are delivered " on Sale or Return," the Pledging 
of the Goods constitutes " an Act adopting the Transaction," 
and the Property thereupon passes. 

KIEKHAM v. ATTENBOROUGH. [1897] 

(6fi L. J. Q. B. 149 ; (1897) 1 Q. B. 201 ; 75 L. T. 543 ; 45 W. R, 

213— C. A.). 

The plaintiff, a manufacturing jeweller, who had been in the 
habit of allowing Winter, who was a retail jeweller, to have 
articles of jewellery " on sale or return," delivered to Winter, 
in the usual course of business, two articles of jewellery, accom- 



OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE. 31 

panied by a contract note specifying the articles delivered and 
the prices, and headed " on sale or return." 

Winter pledged the goods with the defendant, who in good 
faith took them, and made advances to Winter upon them. 

Winter having died without paying for the goods, the plaintiff 
brought the action against the defendant for their return. 

Held, ivhere goods delivered " on sale or return'''' are 
pledged by the buyer, the pledging of the goods by him is 
" an act adopting the transaction" within the meaning of 
sect. 18, rule 4 (a) of the Sale of Goods Act, 1893, so as 
to pass the property in the goods to him, and consequently 
the pledgee obtains a good title to the goods, as against the 
seller. 

Where goods are delivered to a person " on sale or 
return" the person who receives the goods may return the 
goods, but the option is solely his, and the other party 
cannot demand them back, but the only right left is to sue 
for the price or the value of the goods, as the case may be. 

Per Lopes, L.J. The person to whom the goods are 
delivered on sale or return may exercise the option to become 
the purchaser in three different ways : — 

(1) By buying the goods at the price named. 

(2) By retaining them so long as to make it unreasonable 

that he should return them. 

(3/ By doing some act inconsistent with anything except 
his being the purchaser. 



32 CONTRACT. 



Whether a Hire-Purchase Agreement is a Contract or an Agree- 
ment for the Sale of Goods entitling the Hirer to Convert 
them is a Question of Fact. 

HELBY v. MATTHEWS. [1895] 

(64 L. J. Q. B. 465; (1895) A. C. 471 ; 11 R. 232; 72 L. T. 841 ; 
43 W. R. 561 ; 60 J. P. 20.) 

An agreement dated 23rd December, 1892, was entered into 
between " the owner " (the plaintiff), of the one part, and " the 
hirer" (Mr. Brewster), of the other part, by which the owner 
agreed to let a piano on hire to the hirer, and the hirer agreed 
to pay the owner " a rent or hire instalment " at the date of the 
agreement and on a given date of each succeeding month, to 
keep the piano from injury, and not to remove it from his 
custody without the owner's written consent, and if the hirer 
failed to perform the agreement the owner might terminate the 
hiring and retake possession, and the owner agreed that the 
hirer might terminate the agreement by delivering up the 
piano to him, but if the hirer paid thirty-six instalments in the 
manner specified the piano was to become " the sole and 
absolute property of the hirer," but until the full sum men- 
tioned was paid the chattel was to " be and continue the sole 
property of the owner." 

On the 22nd of April, 1893, after only a few of the instalments 
had been paid, Brewster improperly and without the consent of 
the plaintiff pledged the piano with the defendants, who were 
pawnbrokers, as security for an advance. The plaintiff, on 
discovering this, demanded the piano from the defendants, and 
on their refusing to deliver brought an action of trover. The 
defence set up by the defendants was that they had received 
the piano from Brewster in good faith and without notice of any 
claim on the part of the plaintiff, and that Brewster having 
" bought or agreed to buy " it from him they were protected by 
sect. 9 of the Factors Act, 1889. 

IIcbL whether " hire-purchase agreement is a contract 



OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE. 33 

to buy or an agreement to buy is a question of fact in each 
case. In this case it was not a contract or an agreement 
to buy, for, although on payment of all instalments the 
piano was to become the property of Brewster, he might, at 
any time, return it, and upon doing so would no longer be 
liable to make any further payment beyond the monthly 
sum then due. All Brewster had got was an option to 
become the purchaser by payment of all the instalments, and 
could not pass the property to the defendants, and the defen- 
dants were therefore liable in trover. 

Note. — The above case was distinguished from Lee v. Butler, 62 
L. J. Q,. B. 591, on the ground that in that case the so-called 
"hirer" was bound to purchase the goods while in Helby v. 
Matthews he was not. 



A Person cannot, by paying the Debt of another, make that other

Consent of that other Person. 

STOKES v. LEWIS. [1785] 
(1 Ter. Eep. 20; 2 Sm. 12.) 

It had been the custom for the two parishes of St. Yedast's 
and St. Michael-le- Quern to have one set of officers between 
them, who were elected at a joint vestry. The overseers of 
St. Vedast had paid the sexton who was last chosen, and they 
brought this action, claiming they were entitled to be repaid 
half the amount thus expended. It appeared that this sexton 
had been chosen at a meeting summoned by the overseers of 
St. Vedast, but at which the overseers of St. Michael, though 
summoned, had not appeared, as they claimed a right to choose 
a separate sexton for themselves, of which they had given notice 
to the other parish. 

Held, such an action must be grounded either on express 
j. o 



34 CONTRACT. 

or implied consent, and in this case there was neither, for 
the 'whole question as to the appointment of the sexton was 
in dispute, and therefore the plaintiffs were not entitled to 
succeed. 



FORM. 

There may be delivery of a Deed without its being actually 
handed over. 

XENOS AND ANOTHEE v. WICKHAM. [1867] 

(36 L. J. C. P. 313 ; L. E. 2 H. L. 296 ; 16 L. T. 800 ; 
16 W. E. 38.) 

Lascaridi, the insurance broker of the plaintiffs, by their 
direction, applied to the Victoria Insurance Company to insure 
a vessel of the plaintiffs, the Leonidas, for a year. The agent 
of the company initialed the slip for 1,000/. on certain terms. 
The company debited Lascaridi with the amount of the premium, 
and the plaintiffs paid Lascaridi that amount. The policy was 
afterwards, in accordance with the terms agreed upon, filled up 
by the company at their office in the absence of Lascaridi and 
of the plaintiffs, and was signed, sealed and attested in the usual 
manner ; but it was retained in their office according to the 
practice of marine insurance companies until the assured or his 
broker should send for it. When the time came for paying the 
premium the company debited the amount to Lascaridi, and 
sent him a debit note. The clerk of Lascaridi stated that no 
premium was due. The company then sent the policy to 
Lascaridi's clerk, who stated that it had been put forward in 
error, and refpiested that it might be cancelled. Tnereupon a 
memorandum of cancellation was indorsed &lt;&gt;n the policy by the 
company. Lascaridi was charged with the stamp and nothing 
else, and the policy was handed to his clerk that he might get a 
return of the stamp duty. The plaintiffs had never authorised 



FORM. 35 

Lascaridi to cancel the policy, nor did they know that he had 
done so. The ship afterwards being lost, the plaintiffs brought 
an action against the defendant (representing the company) on 
the policy. 

Held, that, although retained in the defendants office, 
under the above circumstances the deed toas full// perfected and 
constituted a complete contract of insurance between the 
parlies, and as the broker had no authority to cancel it, the 
action tvas maintainable. 

Note. — This case is sometimes given as the authority for the 
statement that an offer under seal is irrevocable. But, to the writer, 
it seems not to have that effect. The judgments of the House of 
Lords are based upon the view that the execution of the policy was 
an acceptance by the company of an offer made by the plaintiffs 
through their agent rather than an offer made by the company. In 
other words, when the company had executed the policy, "they 
had effected, through their agent, a complete binding contract." 
The Court regarded the company as holding the policy on behalf of 
the plaintiffs, in accordance with the proved custom of marine 
insurance companies to retain the policy until called for by the 
insured or his broker. There is not, so far as the writer is able to 
judge, one word in the judgments which suggests that the policy 
was to be regarded as an offer irrevocable because under seal. 
The question in the case was whether there could be delivery of the 
policy without the assured or their agent taking corporal possession 
of it, and this was answered in the affirmative. 



A Corporation is only bound by Contracts under Seal, except in 
matters of trifling importance or where it has had the 
benefit of the Contract.

36 CONTRACT. 

referred an application for the execution of sewerage works 
within a portion of their district to a committee, and the com- 
mittee requested Lawford, who was an engineer, to report whai 
works were necessary, aud to give an estimate of the cost. On 
Lawford 's report and estimate, the committee recommended the 
Council to carry out certain works. The Council adopted the 
recommendation and confirmed the minutes of the committee, 
and Lawford performed tli&lt; j work, hut was refused payment 
on the ground that the contract was not under seal. 

Held ^ that a corporation is liable on a contract of which 
it has had the benefit, although the contract is not under 
seal. Where, however, no part of the contract has been 
performed, a corporation is not liable if the contract is not 
tinder seal except where the transaction is trivial and of 
small importance, and where it is of constant occurrence, 
and it is a matter of necessity, from a business point of 
view, that the corporation should be bound without an 
engagement under seal. 



All Contracts of a value of more than 50/. with an Urban 
Authority must be under Seal, or otherwise they will not be 
bound even though they have had the benefit of the Contract. 

YOUNG v. MAYOE OF LEAMINGTON. [1883] 

(52 L. J. Q. B. 713; 8 App. Cas. 517 ; 49 L. T. 1 ; 31 W. E. 925 ; 
47 J. P. 660 — H. L. (E.).) 

The urban authority of Leamington Spa authorised their 
engineer to complete certain works The engineer, who had 
been properly appointed under the seal of the corporation, 
thereupon entered into a written contract with the plaintiff to 
do the work. The plaintiif completed the works, and the cor- 
poration accordingly took possession, but refused to pay for 
them on the ground that the contract was for more than oO/., 



FORM. 37 

and "was therefore required by the Public Health Act, 1875 
(38 &amp; -39 Vict. c. 55), s. 174, to be under seal. 

Held, although the contract had been made by an agent 
appointed under their common seal, and the urban authority 
laid had the benefit of the contract, get the defendants were 
not liable on the ground that the contract iv as not under seal 
under the Public Health Act, 1875 (38 6r 39 Vict. c. 55), 
s. 174, which requires that all contracts made bg an urban 
authority, whereof the value exceeds 501., shall be in writing 
and sealed under the common seal of such authority. 



A Deed may be Varied or Rescinded by a subsequent 
Parol Agreement. 

NASH v. AEMSTEONG. [1861] 

(30 L. J. C. P. 286 ; 10 C. B. (N. S.) 259 ; 7 Jur. (N. S.) 1060 ; 
9 W. E. 782.) 

By a deed one Beatson let to the defendant certain rooms, at 
a rent to be ascertaiued by two valuers. The two valuers were 
duly appointed, but through no default of Beatson or the defen- 
dant the valuation was never made. Beatson died and the 
plaintiff was appointed admiuistrator. It was mutually agreed 
between the plaintiff and the defendant that the valuers should 
not be required to make any valuation, but that the defendant 
should pay the plaintiff the sum of 70/. for use and occupation. 
The plaintiff, however, repented of his bargain and sued on the 
deed, contending that a deed could not be varied by a parol 
agreement. 

Held, the plaintiff must fail, lor an agreement not to call 
for the performance of a (bed, and to substitute certain other 
terms for some of the matters provided tor bg the deed, is 
a g&lt;»&gt;d consideration for a promise to perform such substi- 
tuted service even although (he deed be not thereby released. 



38 CONTRACT, 



GOSS v. NUGENT. (Infra.) 

Where a contract is required to be in writing by the Statute 
of Frauds, all its terms must appear in the note or memorandum. 
Any variation of the terms must be in writing. A verbal 
rescission will, however, suffice. 



A Contract for One Year's Service to commence Day after Agree- 
ment is not a Contract " that is not to be performed within 
the space of One Year from the making thereof" within the 
meaning of sect. 4 of Statute of Frauds. 

SMITH v. (iOLD COAST AND ASHANTI EXPLOBEES, 
LIMITED. [1903] 

(72 L. J. K. B. 235 ; (1903) 1 K. B. 538 ; 88 L. T. 442 ; 
51 W. R. 373— C. A.) 



On the bth December, 1901, the plaintiff entered into a verbal 
agreement with the defendants to act as their solicitor on the 
Gold Coast for one year from the 7th December, 1901. 



Held, that where a contract is made for a year from the 
very next day the contract is one to be performed within a 
year from the making thereof as the law takes no notice of 
any /&gt;&lt;trt of a day, and the contract would terminate on 
the 6th December, 1902, just one year after the agreement. 
If however, the term is to commence a day later than the 
very next day after that on whir// the contract is made, 
then the contract is an agreement " not to be performed 
within the space of one year from the making thereof" 
within the meaning of sect. 4 of the Statute of Frauds. 



FORM. 39 



A Contract which from its Terms might or might not be per- 
formed within the Year is not one " that is not to be 
performed within the space of One Year from the making 
thereof " within the meaning of sect. 4 of the Statute of 
Frauds. 

McGEEGOE v. McGEEGOE. [1888] 

(57 L. J. Q. B. 591 ; 21 Q. B. D. 424 ; 37 W. E. 45 ; 

52 J. P. 772— C. A.) 

The wife having summoned her husband, agreed to withdraw 
the summons on the understanding that they should separate, 
and that the husband should make her a weekly allowance 
for maintenance. The husband got into arrears with the 
allowance, and on an action being brought contended that such 
an agreement, not having been reduced into writing, was void as 
being a contract "that is not to be performed within the space of 
one year from the making thereof " within the 4th section of the 
Statute of Frauds. 

Held, the agreement tvas one that might or might not be 
■performed within the year, and ivas not an agreement which 
appeared from its terms to be incapable of performance 
within the year, and did not therefore come within sect. 4 
of the Statute of Frauds. 

This decision followed the principle laid down in Peter v. Compton 
(1694), Skin. 353, which decided that a contract to pay a sum of 
money on the marriage of Peter did not come within the statute, 
although the marriage did not take place for two years, for Peter 
might have got married the very next day. 



40 CONTRACT. 

To constitute the Contract of Guarantee the Principal must be and 
continue Primarily Liable. 

BIEKMYE v. DARNELL. [1704] 

(6 Mod. 248 ; 2 Ld. Eaym. 1085.) 

J. S. was desirous of borrowing a horse from the plaintiff, 
who, however, mistrusting him, at first refused to let him have 
it. The defendant, however, saw the plaintiff and undertook 
that J. S. should re- deliver the horse safely if he would lend it 
to him. The plaintiff accordingly lent the horse to J. S., who 
never returned it. The plaintiff brought this action against 
Darnell as surety. 

Held, this was a collateral promise to answer for the act 
and make good the default of another within sect. 4 of the 
SI (ttute of Frauds, and void by not being in tvnting. So 
also if two come to a shop and one of them contract for 
goods, and the seller does not care to trust him, whereupon 
the other sags, " Let him have them, and I will undertake 
he shall pay you,'"' that is an undertaking for the act and 
default of another, and within the statute. But if the 
promise be, " / will see you paid,'' 1 or, " 1 tvill be your 
paymaster" it is otherwise. 



To constitute the Contract of Guarantee the Principal Debtor must 
be and remain Liable ; if he does not the Contract is one of 
Indemnity, and does not come within Sect. 4 of the Statute 
of Frauds. 

MOUNTSTEPHEN v. LAKEMAN. [1871] 
(43 L. J. Q. 13. 188; L. R. 7 ILL. 17; 30 L T. 437; 22 W. K. 017.) 

The plaintiff had been employed by a local board of health to 
construct a main sewer, between which and the houses along the 
line of street connections had yet to be made. The owners of 



FORM. 41 

the houses were, under sect. 69 of 11 &amp; 12 Vict. c. 63, liable to 
make these connections after the expiration of a twenty-one 
clays' notice from the board calling upon them to do so. The 
owners of the houses did not seem disposed to make the 
connections, and the notices were served upon them. The 
plaintiff had, by direction of the board, brought on the ground 
the necessary pipes. The plaintiff was asked by the defendant, 
who was the chairman of the local board of health, if he had 
any objection to making the connections. The plaintiff in reply 
said, " I have none, if you or the board will order the work, or 
become responsible for the payment." The defendant in reply 
said, " Go and do the w T ork, and I will see you paid." 
Accordingly the plaintiff did the work, and applied to the 
board for payment. The board disclaiming all liability, the 
plaintiff sued the defendant. 

Held, that the defendant was personally liable, and that 
whether or not the parties or either of them intended only a 
contract of suretyship, there was a personal contract by the 
chairman on which he was primarily liable, and not merely 
a promise to ansiver for the debt, default or miscarriage of 
another, such as would require a memorandum thereof in 
tvriting under sect. 4 of the Statute of Frauds. 

And by Lord Selborne, there can be no suretyship unless 
there be a principal debtor constituted by matters ex post 
facto, if not existing at the time of the transaction. 



42 CONTRACT. 



To satisfy the Statute of Frauds, the Memorandum or Note in 
Writing must contain all the Terms of the Contract, except 
in Cases of Guarantee under 19 &amp; 20 Vict. c. 97, s. 3, 
whereby Parol Evidence of the Consideration for a Guarantee 
may be given. 

HOLMES v. MITCHELL. [1859] 
(28 L. J. G. P. 301 ; 7 C. B. (N. S.) 361 ; 6 Jur. (N. S.) 73. 

The defendant addressed the following letter to the plaintiff 
relating to a proposed mortgage of certain leasehold property : — 
" I saw Mr. Lyne this day, and I told him he had better call 
on you, as he seemed very anxious to have the mortgage 
completed, and I thought he offered very fair ; but do as you 
please about it. I will take any responsibility myself respecting 
it, should there be any." After the letter had been received the 
plaintiff had an interview with Mr. Lyne, and, on the faith of 
such letter, lent 400/. to Spooner and Cubitt on the said lease- 
hold security. 

Held, that the letter was not a sufficient memorandum or 
note in writing within sect. 4 of the Statute of Frauds, as 
the tvhole promise could not be made out without reference to 
parol evidence. 

The recent statute 19 &lt;y 20 Vict. c. 97, s. 3, it is true, 
abrogates the rule laid down in Wain v. Walters (5 East, 
10), and enables a party to give parol evidence of the con- 
sideration for a guarantee. But a consideration expressed 
in writing formerly discharged two offices: it sustained lite 
promise, and might also explain it. Now, however, parol 
evidence, though it mag supply the consideration, cannot go 
further and explain the promise. We, therefore, think the 
ruling of the learned judge al the trial was correct.

A Letter Signed by the Party to be Charged acknowledging the 
Contract, but stating an intention to Repudiate it, may be a 
sufficient " Memorandum or Note in Writing " to satisfy the 
Statute of Frauds. 

BUXTON v. BUST. [1872] 

(41 L. J. Ex. 173 ; L. E. 7 Ex. 279 ; 27 L. T. 210 ; 
20 W. E. 1014— Ex. Ch.) 

The plaintiff, on the 11th January, 1871, verbally agreed 
with the defendant to buy his wool at a price exceeding 10/., 
and wrote the terms in a bought note, which the defendant took 
away. One of those terms was, " the whole to be cleared in 
about twenty- one days." On the 8th February the defendant 
wrote and signed a letter to the plaintiff, in which he complained 
of delay of plaintiff in not having taken away the wool, although 
twenty-eight days had elapsed, and finishing up by saying : — 
" I shall therefore consider the deal off, as you have not com- 
pleted your part of the contract." On the next day the plaintiff 
asked the defendant for " a copy of the contract," and on the 
same day the defendant wrote and signed a letter to the 
plaintiff : — " I beg to enclose a copy of your letter of the 11th of 
January, 1871." On the same paper, and underneath, there 
was, in the defendant's writing, a copy of the bought note of the 
11th January. The plaintiff having sued the defendant for not 
delivering the wool, 

Held j that there was a sufficient memorandum in 
writing to charge the defendant within the meaning of the 
Statute of Frauds, 29 Car. 2, c. 3, s. 17. 

Note. — Sect. 17 of Statute of Frauds was repealed and sub- 
stantially re-enacted by the Sale of Goods Act, s. 4 (1).

Memorandum or Note in Writing must be made before Action 

brought. 

LUCAS v. DIXON. [1889 
(08 L. J. Q. B. 161 ; 22 Q. B. D. 357 ; 37 W. R. 370— C. A. 

The plaintiff bronglit an action to recover the price of goods 
sold by the plaintiff to the defendant, the value of which was 
more than 10/. 

The contract was a verbal one, but the plaintiff sought to 
make the defendant liable on an affidavit which he had sworn 
in answer to an application for judgment under Ord. XIV. 
The affidavit set forth the necessary particulars of the contract. 

Held, the affidavit was not a sufficient compliance tvith 
the Statute of Frauds, as tin- memorandum or note in 
writing must be in existence before the action is brought. 



Acceptance of Offer, subject to Execution of Formal Contract, 

creates a Binding Contract, provided the Terms are clearly 

embodied in the Offer. 
Parties to a Contract must be so described as to be identified with 

ease. The terms "Owner'" or "Proprietor" sufficiently 

describe a Vendor. 

ROSSITEB v. MILLER. [1878] 

(48 L. J. Ch. 10 ; 3 App. Cas. 1124 ; 39 L. T. 17:; ; 
26 W. R. 865.) 

The defendant, desirous of purchasing certain land, entered 
into negotiations witli 0. White, who was acting as the agent of 
the vendors. Defendant made White a verbal offer, whereupon 
White wrote saying that " the proprietors " had accepted his 
offer " subject to the conditions and stipulations printed on the 
plan." The defendanl wrote a Letter referring to the offer and 



FORM. 45 

introducing a stipulation which was agreed to in another letter by 
White. In accordance with one of the conditions of sale a 
formal agreement was prepared by the solicitors and forwarded 
to the defendant, who refused to sign it or complete the purchase. 
The plaintiff brought this action for specific performance of the 
agreement. 

Held, that the correspondence between the defendant and 
White, the agent of the Vendor*, amounted to a complete 
contract within the Statute of Frauds, and that under the 
circumstances the execution of a formal deed was not 
necessary, and that the defendant was bound to specif call// 
perform the contract. 

Held, also, that the terms "owner" or "proprietor" of 
the property sold sufficiently described the vendor ; for Id 
certum est quod, eertuni reddi potest. 



A Recital in a Will of a Contract by the person to be charged 
therewith may be a sufficient Memorandum or Note in 
Writing- to satisfy sect. 4 of the Statute of Frauds. 

IN EE HOYLE— HOYLE v. HOYLE. [1893] 

(62 L. J. Ch. 182 ; (1893) 1 Oh. 84 ; 2 E. 145 ; 67 L. T. 674 ; 

41 W. B, 81— C. A.) 

A member of a firm of solicitors having verbally agreed to 
guarantee to the firm the amount of his son's indebtedness to 
the firm, made his will, whereby he recited that he had 
guaranteed the firm against loss in respect of his son's 
indebtedness, and directed that the amount found due from the 
son should be taken into account in determining the son's share 
under the will. After the testator's death the surviving members 
of the firm claimed the benefit of such guarantee or indemnity. 

Held, that the promise took effect as a promise of 
indemnity to the two surviving partners, and ivas not a 



46 CONTRACT. 

contract of guarantee under sect. 4 of the Statute of 
Frauds, but that, assuming the promise to be within 
sect. 4 of the Statute of Frauds, the recital was a sufficient 
note or memorandum thereof 



A Note in Writing under the Sale of Goods Act is not rendered 

invalid by omission of price where none fixed. In such 

case a reasonable price will be assumed. If a price was 
fixed but omitted, the Memorandum is Bad. 

HOADLEY v. MacLAINE. [1834] 
(3 L. J. C. P. 162 ; 4 M. &amp; Scott, 340 ; 10 Bing. 482.) 

The defendant gave the plaintiff a written order for a 
carriage to be completed at a future time ; no reference or 
allusion was made to any specific price. Subsequently to the 
completion of the work and approval of it by the defendant, 
the defendant wrote a letter to the plaintiff desiring the carriage 
to be sent home, with the bill. In an action against him for 
non-acceptance, 

Held, that the letter, coupled with the order, constituted 
a sufficient note or memorandum in writing of the bargain 
under sect. 17 of the Statute of Frauds as extended by 
9 Geo. 4, c. 14, s. 7, though such letter and order zvere 
silent as to price, and that plain tiff was entitled to recover 
on a quantum valebat. Where, however, a price has been 
fixed but omitted from the memorandum, no evidence can be 
given of it. 

Note. — This principle now applies to contracts under the Sale 
of Goods Act, but not to contracts under sect. 4 of the Statute of 
Frauds.

Parol Evidence is admissible to connect two or more Separate 
Documents which are not connected together by Internal 
Evidence, provided they sufficiently refer to one another. 

LONG v. MILLAR. [1879] 
(48 L.J. C. P. 596; 4C.P.D.450; 41L.T. 306; 27 W. E. 720— 0. A.) 

The plaintiff having agreed to purchase certain land, signed 
the following memorandum : — " I agree to purchase the three 
plots of land in Richford Street, Hammersmith, for 310/., 
and to pay as deposit and in part payment of the purchase- 
money 31/." 

The defendant signed and gave to the plaintiff the following 
receipt: — "Received of Gr. Long 31/. as a deposit on the 
purchase of three plots of land at Hammersmith." 

Held, that the two documents sufficiently referred to one 
another to constitute a memorandum of the contract within 
sect. 4 of the Statute of Frauds, and that parol evidence 
was admissible to connect the two documents. 

Oliver v. Hunting and Pearce v. Gardner, vide infra, pp. 47, 
49, extend this principle, and admit parol evidence to connect 
documents which do not refer to one another. 



Where a Written Contract is contained in Separate Documents, 
which are not Connected by Internal Evidence, Parol 
Evidence is admissible to supply the Connection. 

OLIVER v. HUNTING. [1890] 
(59 L. J. Ch. 255 ; 44 Ch. D. 205 ; 62 L. T. 108 ; 38 W. E. 618.) 

The plaintiff claimed specific performance of a contract to sell 
to her certain land at Fletton, in the coimty of Huntingdon. 



48 CONTRACT. 

On the 7th of September, ] 888, the following memorandum 
of that date was signed : — 

" Memorandum of terms of agreement between Mr. Hunting 
and Mrs. Oliver. 
" Price 2,375/. 
" Vendor to make good title. 
" Purchaser to pay for her own conveyance. 
" Fixtures included in purchase. 
" Purchase to be settled as soon as possible. 
" Possession on the 25th of September. 

" Time allowed up to the 1st of January next to clear bricks. 
" Deposit to be paid on the 1 Oth. 
" Stamford, September 7th, 1888. 

" Joseph Hunting. 

" September 7th, 1888. 

" E. Oliver." 

On the 12th of September, 1888, the defendant signed and 
sent to the plaintiff the following letter : — 

" Peterborough, September 12th, 1888. 
" Mrs. Oliver, 

" Dear Madam, — I beg to acknowledge receipt of cheque 
value 375/. on account of the purchase-money for the Fletton 
Manor House Estate, for which I thank you. 

" Yours truly, 

" Joseph Hunting." 

The defendant resisted specific performance, on the ground 
that there was no sufficient memorandum in writing to satisfy 
the Statute of Frauds. 

All the terms necessary to constitute a contract for the 
purchase of land, except a description of the land itself, being 
contained in the memorandum of the 7th September, the 
plaintiff claimed he was entitled to connect the two documents 
together, and that being done there was a sufficient contract in 
writing. 

Held) per Kekewich y J., that parol evidence ivas admix- 



FORM. 49 

sible to connect the two documents, and on such evidence 
specific performance was decreed. 

Where a memorandum, alleged to constitute a contract in 
writing, is contained in two or more separate documents, 
which are not connected together by internal evidence, parol 
evidence is admissible to supply the connection. 



A Letter signed by Person to be charged and sent to the other 
Party, but not containing his Name, is not sufficient to 
constitute a Memorandum or Note in Writing under Sect. 4 
of the Statute of Frauds, but Parol Evidence may be given 
to connect the Envelope in which the Letter was sent and on 
which the Name of the other Party appears with the letter. 

PEAECE v. GARDNER. [1897] 
(66 L. J. Q. B. 457 ; (1897) 1 Q. B. 688 ; 76 L. T. 441 ; 45 W. R. 

518— C. A.) 

The defendant wrote and signed a letter to the plaintiff, in 
which, however, the name of the plaintiff did not appear. The 
letter contained all the terms of the contract for the sale of 
certain gravel which was in situ on the land of the plaintiff. 

Held, evidence may be given to connect the letter with the 
envelope in which it was sent, and the two then constitute 
one document, and as all the terms appear therein, the 
Statute of Frauds is satisfied. 



Non-compliance with Statute of Frauds does not void Contract, 
but renders it Not Provable. 

LEROUX v. BROWN. [1852] 
(22 L. J. C. P. 1 ; 12 C. B. 801 ; 16 Jur. 1021 ; 1 W. R, 22.) 

The defendant entered into an agreement with the plaintiff at 
Calais to employ him for one year from a future day at J 00/. a 



50 CONTRACT. 

year. Such a contract, though not in writing, was valid in 
France, and could be enforced by the law of that country. 

Held, an action cannot be maintained in this country 
upon a parol agreement which is not to be performed within 
a gear, although mark in France, and valid and enforceable 
there. 

Sect. 4 of the Statute of Frauds does not sag thai unless 
the requisites required bg that Act are complied ivith the 
contract shall be void, but only that u no action shall be 
brought upon it" The legislature contemplated a contract 
good before any writing, but not enforceable without the 
writing as evidence of it. 



Contracts which should have been in Writing under the Statute 
of Frauds will not be Enforced on the ground of Part Per- 
formance, except where they relate to an Interest in Land. 

BEITAIN v. EOSSITEE. [1882] 

(48 L. J. Ex. 362; 11 Q. B. D. 123; 40 L. T. 240; 
27 W. E. 482— C. A.) 

On the 21st April, 1877, the plaintiff was engaged by the 
defendants to act as a clerk for one year from the 23rd April. 
The contract was reduced into writing, but never signed. After 
serving for seven months, the defendant was discharged, after 
having been given a month's notice aud all his wages having 
been duly paid. The plaintiff thereupon brought an action for 
wrongful dismissal. It was clearly a contract not to be performed 
within a year, and there was no sufficient memorandum in 
writing to satisfy the Statute of Frauds, as there was no 
signature of the party to be charged. The plaintiff therefore 



FORM. 51 

contended there had been a sufficient part performance by him 
to take the case out of the statute. 

Held, the equitable doctrine of part performance only 
applies where the contract relates to an interest in land, and 
does not apply to contracts of service, and therefore the 
action failed. 



Part Performance of Contracts relating to an Interest in Land 
must be solely referable to the Contract to take the case out 
of the Statute of Frauds. 

MADDI80N v. ALDERSON. [1883] 

(52 L. J. Q. B. 737 ; 8 App. Cas. 473 ; 49 L. T. 303 ; 31 W. R. 820 ; 

47 J. P. 821.) 

The plaintiff was induced to serve Alderson, as his house- 
keeper, for many years, and to give up other prospects of 
advancement in life, by a verbal promise made by him to leave 
her a farm for her life. Alderson signed a will, leaving the 
farm in accordance with his promise ; but the will was not duly 
witnessed. 

The plaintiff accordingly brought this action against the 
executors of Alderson, claiming that as the agreement related 
to an interest in land, and there had been a part performance 
on her part, she was entitled to the farm referred to in the 
unwitnessed will. 

Held, that part performance must be some act that 
plans the parties unequivocally in a position different from 
that which, according to their legal rights, they would he in 
if there ivas no contract, and that an act which, though in 
I ruth done in pursuance of a contract, admits of explanation 

k 2 



52 CONTRACT. 

tvithout supposing a contract, is not, in general, an act of 
part performance taking the case out of the statute. And 
as the plaintiff merely continued in Alderson's service, 
though tvithout any actual payment of wages, this was not 
an act unequivocal/// rejerable to a contract so as to exclude 
the operation of the Statute of Frauds. 

Note. — This was not an act unequivocally referable to the 
contract, as the plaintiff might have continued iu Aide: son's 
service from motives of affection, &amp;c.

4 L. T. 546 ; 9 W. E. 702.) 

The plaintiff, a dentist, supplied two sets of teeth to Frances 
Penson, who died before they could be fitted to her mouth. 
There being no memorandum or note in writing to satisfy 
sect. 17 of the Statute of Frauds, the plaintiff in an action 
against the executors contended that it was not a contract for 
the sale of goods but a contract to do certain work and labour, 
and that the materials were merely ancillary to the work and 
labour. 

Held, the contract tvas one for the sale of goods and not 
for work and labour, and a count for work, labour and 
materials was not maintainable. 

Sect. 4 of Sale of Goods Act overrules and re-enacts sect. 1 7 of 
the Statute of Frauds.

The comparison of an Article purchased with a Sample may 
constitute a sufficient " Receipt and Acceptance " to satisfy

by Sale of Goods Act, 1893, c. 71, s. 4. 

PAGE v. MORGAN. [1885] 

(54 L. J. Q. B. 434 ; 15 Q. B. D. 228 ; 53 L. T. 126 ; 

33 W. R. 793— C A.) 

The plaintiff sold to the defendant by sample certain wheat, 
which was put into a barge and sent to the defendant's mill, 
where it arrived in the evening, and on the following morning 
was, by order of the defendant's foreman, taken into the mill 
and there examined with the sample. The defendant then 
rejected it as not being equal to sample. The wheat was 
put back into the barge and remained there for some weeks, 
when it was sold by order of the Court. It was not the custom 
at the defendant's mill to examine wheat whilst it was in the 
barges. In an action by the plaintiff to recover damages from 
the defendant for not accepting the wheat, the jury found 
that it was equal to sample and that the plaintiff had acted 
reasonably. 

Held, the legislature by " acceptance and receipt'''' meant 
such a dealing ivith the goods as would amount to a recogni- 
tion of the contract, and that there v) as evidence for the jury 
of acceptance of the wheat sufficient to satisfy sect. 17 of 
the Statute of Frauds [now replaced by the Sale of Goods 
Act, 1893, s. 4). Such an acceptance is not such as to 
preclude the purchaser from saying the goods are not equal 
to sample, but the jury having found the wheat was, in fact, 
up to sample, the plaintiff -was entitled to damages for breach 
of contract. 



54 CONTRACT. 



Special Contracts by Carriers must be in Writing and Signed by 
Consignor, and be " Just and Reasonable." 

PEEK v. THE NORTH STAFFORDSHIRE RAILWAY CO. 

[1863] 

(32 L. J. Q. B. 241 ; E. B. &amp; E. i)o8, l J86 ; 10 H. L. &lt; '. 473 ; '.) Jur. 
914; 8 L. T. 768; 11 W. R. 1023.) 

The plaintiff, who desired to send certain marble by rail, had 
received printed notices from the defendants stating, among 
other conditions, that the company would not be responsible 
for the loss or injury to any marble unless declared and insured 
accordingly. Some correspondence ensued as to the rates of 
insurance for marbles, and the agent was informed verbally 
what the defendants' charge for the carriage of the marble 
would be at the insured rate and what at the uninsured rate. 
The plaintiff subsequently instructed the company to forward 
the marble "not insured." The marble was forwarded as 
directed, and when delivered was found to be damaged by 
exposure or rain. In an action for this damage by the plaintiff 
against the defendants as common carriers, the company 
pleaded, under the Railway and Canal Traffic Act, 1851, s. 7, 
that the marble was delivered to be carried by them subject to 
a certain special contract, whereby it was agreed that they 
should not be responsible for the loss or injury to the marble 
unless declared and insured according to their value, and that 
the same was not, nor was any part thereof, so declared or 
insured, and that the marble was delivered and received on such 
condition, and that such a condition was a just and reasonable 
one. 

Held, that no general notice given by a railway 
company is valid in law for the purpose of limiting the 
common law liability of the company as carriers; but 
■such common law liability mag be limited by conditions 
embodied in a special emit rue I in u: riling, signed t&gt;g the 



CONSIDERATION. 55 

owner or person delivering the goods, provided such con- 
ditions are just and reasonable ; that the conditions 
sought to be imposed in this case were neither just nor 
reasonable, as their effect ivould be to exempt the company 
from responsibility for injury, however caused, whether by 
their own negligence or even by fraud or dishonesty on the 
part of their servants, and that the plaintiffs were therefore 
entitled to damages. 



CONSIDERATION. 



Consideration is Necessary to the Validity of every Simple 
Contract. The Court will not consider the Adequacy if 
Consideration actually exists. 

BAINBRIDQE v. FIEMSTONE. [1838] 
(8 Ad. &amp; E. 743 ; 1P.&amp;D.2; 1W.W.&amp;H. 600.) 

Plaintiff, at defendant's request, consented to allow him to 
weigh two of the plaintiff's boilers. The defendant promised to 
give them up, after weighing, in as perfect condition as they 
were in at the time of the consent. The defendant failed to 
give up the boilers in as good condition as they were in before, 
and, on being sued, pleaded there was no consideration for the 
agreement. 

Held, the plaintiff"' 's parting with the possession of the 
boilers for a short time was a good consideration. The 
Court will not look into the adequacy of the consideration. 



56 CONTRACT. 



Consideration must move from Promisee. A valuable Considera- 
tion may consist either in some right, interest, profit, or 
benefit accruing to the one party, or some forbearance, 
detriment, loss, or responsibility given, suffered, or under- 
taken by the other. 

FLEMING v. BANK OF NEW ZEALAND. [1900] 
(69 L. J. P. C. 120 ; (1900) A. C. 577 ; 83 L. T. 1— P. C.) 

The plaintiff instructed an agent to pay money into his bank 
to meet certain cheques. The agent, with the bank's consent, 
deposited store warrants, in place of money, as security. This 
was done without the customer's authority, but was subsequently 
approved by him. The cheques were, in the first instance, 
dishonoured, but were paid on the day following their first 
presentation. The plaintiff sued the defendant for dishonouring 
the cheques. The case was heard, on appeal from the Appeal 
Court of New Zealand, in the Privy Council. The Privy 
Council, in giving judgment, accepted the definition of con- 
sideration as laid down in Carrie v. Misa, L. R. 10 Ex. D. 153, 
that " A valuable consideration in the sense of the law may 
consist either in some right, interest, profit, or benefit accruing 
to the one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss, or 
responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other." 

Held, there was a sufficient consideration moving from 
the customer to the bank entitling him to substantial 
damages. 



CONSIDERATION. 57 



No Stranger to the Consideration can Sue upon the Contract 
although made for his Benefit. 

TWEDDLE v. ATKINSON. [1861]

468; 9 W. E. 781.) 

After a marriage between the plaintiff and the daughter of 
William Gruy, the two fathers-in-law, in order to provide a 
marriage portion, agreed respectively to pay two sums of money 
to the plaintiff, and they also agreed that the plaintiff should 
have full power to sue for the said sums of money. The 
plaintiff was not a party to the agreement. After the deaths of 
the two fathers-in-law the plaintiff brought an action upon the 
agreement, against the executor of William Guy, his wife's 
father, to recover the sum of money which William Gruy had 
agreed to pay him. 

Held, that he could not recover, as he was not a part// to 
the agreement, and no consideration ran from him. 



Past Consideration is no Consideration in Law even though based 
on a Moral Obligation. A Promise to a Debtor to Pay the 
Debt he Owes to Another need not be in Writing under 
Sect. 4 of the Statute of Frauds. 

EASTWOOD v. KEN YON. 
(9 L. J. Q. B. 409; 11 A. &amp; E. 438; 3 P. &amp; D. 276; 4 Jur. 1081.) 

The plaintiff, who was the guardian of Sarah Sutcliffe, spent 
140/., partly on the girl's education and partly to keep her 
property in repair, and, as he had not sufficient for that purpose, 
he borrowed the money from Blackburn, to whom he gave a 
promissory note. Sarah Sutcliffe, after coming of age, married 
the defendant, who promised the plaintiff that he would pay the 



58 CONTRACT. 

promissory note, but never did so, and the plaintiff brought 
this action against the defendant on the strength of his promise. 

Held, the defendant was not liable, for there was no 
consideration for the promise. A past consideration, though 
based on a moral obligation, being no legal consideration 
unless moved by a previous request, express or implied. 

Held, also, that sect. 4 of the Statute of Frauds, which 
requires promises u to answer for the debt, default or 
miscarriage of another person " to be in writing, only 
a j&gt; plies to promises made to the person to whom another is 
answerable, and does not apply, as in this case, where the 
promise is made to the debtor himself. 

Lampleigh v. Brathwait (1616, Hob. 105), which is often cited 
as the leading case, does not illustrate this principle so well as the 
above case. 



Forbearance to sue is a good Consideration unless the Plaintiff 
has no Cause of Action and knows he has none. 

WADE v. SIMEON. [1846] 
(15 L. J. C. P. 114; 2 C. B. 548; 3 D. &amp; L. 587; 10 Jur. 412.) 

An action having been brought by the plaintiff, the defendant, 
in consideration of the plaintiff dropping the action, promised 
to pay the amount claimed, with costs. The defendant not 
having paid the costs, the plaintiff brought this action. The 
defendant having pleaded that the plaintiff had never any good 
cause of action in the action compromised, as he well knew, the 
plaintiff demurred, and in doing so admitted this to be true. 

Held, forbearance to sue is a good consideration zvhere 
/he plaintiff has a bona fide cause of action, but mere 
forbearance to prosecute a suit in which the plaintiff has no 
cause of action, and knows he has none, and in which he 
must eventually fail, is no consideration. 



CONSIDERATION. 59 

A Promise to perform an existing Contract is no Consideration, but 
if something arises which makes the Performance of the 
Contract more dangerous or laborious, a fresh Consideration 
may be thereby created. 

HABTLEY v. PONSONBY. [1857] 

(26 L. J. Q. B. 322 ; 7 El. &amp; Bl. 872 ; 3 Jur. (N. 8.) 746 ; 
5 W. B, 659.) 

A ship, being on a voyage from Liverpool to Port Phillip, in 
Australia, and back, when in port at Port Phillip became so 
short-handed that it was dangerous to life to proceed only with 
the reduced crew. The captain, being unable to procure 
additional hands, voluntarily promised the remaining seamen, 
who were under articles for the whole voyage, an additional 
sum if they would assist in taking the ship to her next port. 
On the captain being sued on his promise, it was 

Held, that the seamen ivere not bound to proceed on the 
voyage, as it involved additional labour and risk of life, 
and that the promise was therefore binding on the captain. 



Payment of a Smaller Sum in satisfaction of a Larger is not a 
good discharge of a Debt unless it creates some Benefit to 
the Creditor. 

GODDARD v. O'BEIEN. [1882] 
(9 Q. B. D. 37 ; 46 L. T. 306 ; 30 W. E. 549.) 

The defendant being indebted to the plaintiff in 125/. 7s. 9d. 
for goods sold and delivered, gave the plaintiff a cheque for 
100/. payable on demand, which the plaintiff accepted in satis- 
faction of the debt. The plaintiff, becoming dissatisfied with 
this amount, sued the defendant for the balance. 

Held, that although the payment of 1001. in cash would 
not have been a good accord and ■satisfaction, get there 



60 CONTRACT. 

having been a payment to and acceptance by the plaintiff of 
a cheque, there was a good accord and satisfaction by reason 
of the cheque being a negotiable security ; for, if there is any 
bene///, or even any legal possibility of benefit, to the creditor 
thrown in, that additional weight will turn the scale and 
render the consideration sufficient to support the agreement. 

N.B. — This is an instance of the whittling down of the principle 
laid down in Cumber and Wane, 1 Strange, 126, and Shirley's L. I '. 
402, that payment of a smaller sum in satisfaction of a larger is no 
discharge of a debt. The exceptions to this rule are when : — 

(1) A negotiable instrument is given as in this case. 

(2) Something different is given. 

(3) A receipt under seal is given. 

(4) The amount is disputed. 

(5) A composition with creditors is entered iuto— the consideration 

being the forbearance of the other creditors. 

(6) Payment is made earlier than obligatory. 



The Consideration for a Composition is the Mutual Agreement by 
the Parties to it to forbear to enforce their Rights against 
the Debtor on his promising to make over a part of his 
Income to them. 

GOOD v. CHEESMAN. [18.31] 
(9 L. J. (0. S.) K. B. 23 4 ; 2 B. &amp; Ad. 328 ; 4 Car. &amp; P. 513.) 

The defendant, being in financial difficulties, called the plaintiff 
and three other creditors together, and the four creditors signed 
an agreement which stated that the defendant being iudebted to 
them and being unable to make an immediate payment, they had 
agreed to accept payment of the debt by his agreeing and 
covenanting to pay to a nominee of theirs one-third of his annual 
income and executing a warrant of attorney as a collateral 
security until payment. The defendant was present when this 
paper was signed and verbally agreed to its terms. Xo trustee 



CONSIDERATION. 61 

was ever nominated or any covenant entered into or any warrant 
of attorney executed as mentioned in the agreement. Bills of 
exchange which became due before the agreement was entered 
into not having been paid, this action was commenced. 

Held, that a new agreement had been substituted for the 
original contract ivith the debtor ; the consideration to each 
creditor being the engagement of the others not to press their 
individual claims against the debtor, so that none of them 
could sue upon the original demand unless the debtor laid 
failed to perform his part of the agreement. 

That no trustee was ever nominated or ang covenant 
entered into or an// warrant of attorney executed, having been 
due to the default of the plaintiff , the defendant was not liable 
upon the bills of exchange. 



A Gratuitous Bailee is liable for Gross Negligence, but not for 
Nonfeasance. 

COGGS v. BERNARD. [1703] 
(3 Lord Raymond, 163 ; 1 Sin. L. C. 167.) 

The plaintiff desiring to transfer several hogsheads from one 
cellar to another, accepted the services of the defendant, who 
undertook to remove them safely and securely, but was to get 
nothing for his trouble. The defendant, in removing the casks, 
was guilty of such negligence that one of them was stove in and 
much valuable brandy was lost, 

Held, that although the breach of an undertaking ivhich 
was voluntary is not a good ground for an action, yet where 
a gratuitous bailee acts ivith gross negligence in the per- 
formance of his undertaking , he is liable for the damage 
(■//used thereby. The defend/tit f was therefore liable. 



62 CONTRACT. 

Even a Deed is void if the Consideration therefor is illegal or 

immoral. 

COLLINS v. BLANTERN. [1767] 
(2 Wils. 341 ; 1 8m. L. 0. 355.) 

One Rudge was prosecuting five men for wilful and corrupt 
perjury. The prisoners, who were about to take their trial, 
pleaded not guilty. Whereupon the prosecutor, the prisoners 
and some of their friends put their heads together and the 
plaintiff Collins promised to pay Rudge 300/. to abstain from 
giving evidence against the prisoners on condition that Blantern 
and his friends should indemnify him by executing a bond in 
his favour. Thereupon the plaintiff paid Rudge the 350/., but 
the defendants refused to pay the plaintiff, on the ground that 
the bond had been given on an illegal consideration and was 
therefore void. 

Held, that the consideration for the bond was to stifle a 
criminal prosecution and was therefore illegal, and the bond 
could not be sued upon, and that where a party to an 
unlawful contract has paid tin' money stipulated to be 
paid thereunder he shall not have the help of the Court to 
recover it.

Onus is on Plaintiff to prove that Goods supplied to an Infant 
are Necessaries, i.e., suitable to his condition in life and 
actual requirements at time of sale. 

NASH v. INMAN. [1908] 

(77 L. J. K. B. 626 ; (1908) 2 K. B. 1 ; 98 L. T. 658 ; 

24 T. L. B. 401— C. A.) 

The plaintiff, a tailor, supplied goods to the value of 
14-3/. 10s. 3d. to the defendant, who was the son of a prosperous 
architect. The defendant was a freshman at Cambridge, and 
the goods supplied were suits of clothes, great-coats, and eleven 
fancy waistcoats at 2/. 2s. each. The plaintiff brought an action 
against the defendant, who pleaded infancy. 

Held, the plaintiff having failed to prove the articles 
ivere necessaries, was not entitled to succeed, for ivhere an 
action is brought for the price of goods sold and delivered, 
and the defendant pleads and proves infancy, the onus is on 
the plaintiff to prove that the goods ivere necessaries within 
the meaning of that term, as defined in sect. 2 of the Sale 
of Goods Act, 1893 — that is to say, that the goods were 
suitable not only to the condition in life of the infant, but 
also to his actual requirements at the time of the sale and 
delivery. 



64 CONTRACT. 

Continuing Contracts entered into by an Infant are not void but 
voidable, and if not repudiated within reasonable time after 
coming- of age are binding on Infant. 

EDWAEDS v. CARTER. [1893] 

(63 L. J. Ch. 100 ; (1893) A. C. 360 ; 1 R. 218 ; 69 L. T. 153 ; 
58 J. P. 4.) 

Upon his marriage, Martin Albert Silber covenanted to settle 
any property he might succeed to under his father's will. Shortly 
after the marriage the son attained full age. The father died 
more than three years later, leaving by will property of con- 
siderable value to the son. Fourteen months afterwards the 
son, who had up to that time received an annuity under the 
covenant which had been settled upon him b}^ his father, who 
was a party to the covenant, gave notice purporting to repudiate 
the settlement. 

Held, that a continuing covenant entered into by an in- 
fant is not void but voidable, and mast be re/mdiatrd within 
a reasonable time of coming of age, and Unit an infant is not 
entitled to wait and see how, in respect of any particular 
sum of money, the covenant will operate, and that the repu- 
diation was too late and therefore ineffectual. 



Contracts which are for the benefit of an Infant are binding 
upon him. 

GREEN v. THOMPSON. [1899] 

(68 L. J. Q. B. 719; (1899) 2 Q. B. 1 ; 80 L. T. 691 ; 48 W. R, 31 ; 
63 J P. 486— D.) 

An apprenticeship deed entered into by an infant apprentice 
contained a stipulation that the apprentice shall not be instructed 
or paid wages on days on which the business of the master shall 



CAPACITY OF PARTIES. 65 

be at a standstill " through accident beyond the control of the 
master." 

Held, that the stipulation is not so detrimental to the 
infant as to be invalid and incapable of being enforced 
against him, and that such a stipulation to be invalid must 
be so much to the detriment of the infant as to render it 
unfair that the infant should be bound by if. 



An Infant cannot ratify even a Contract of Marriage after he 
comes of age, but evidence may be given of a fresh Promise 
to Marry after coming of age. 

DITCHAM v. WOEEALL. [1880] 

(49 L. J. C. P. 688 ; 5 C. P. D. 410 ; 43 L. T. 28(5 ; 29 W. E. 59 ; 

44 J. P. 799.) 

While still an infant the defendant became engaged to the 
plaintiff, and the parties continued on the footing of an engaged 
couple after the defendant came of age. After coming of age 
the plaintiff, at the request of the defendant, fixed the date of 
the marriage. He ultimately repented of his choice and refused 
to marry the plaintiff. Thereupon the girl brought an action 
for breach of promise of marriage. 

Held, that although a contract entered into by an infant 
cannot be ratified by him when he comes of age, yet the 
request of the defendant to the plaintiff to fix the day of 
their marriage was sufficient evidence of a fresh promise by 
the defendant to marry the plaintiff , by ivhich he was bound.

6H CONTRACT. 

An Infant cannot be made liable on a Contract, where Infancy 
would be a Defence, by the action being framed in tort. 

JENNINGS v. RUNDALL. [1799] 
(8 Term Reports, 336 ; 4E.E. 680.) 

The defendant, an infant, hired a mare from the plaintiff, and 
so overrode her that she was damaged. The plaintiff brought 
this action, not for negligence in the performance of the contract, 
to which the defendant might have pleaded infancy, but in tort 
for wrongfully and injuriously riding the mare. 

Held, the defendant was not liable, for a plaintiff cannot 
convert an action founded &lt;&gt;n a rant rod into a tort so a* to 
charge an infant defendant. 

But see Hurnard v. Haggis, infra, where an infant was made 
liable on a tort which, though originating in contract, was wholly 
independent of the contract. 



A Contract by a Lunatic binds him, unless it can be shown that 
his insanity was known at the time to the other contracting 
party. 

THE IMPERIAL LOAN CO. v. STONE. [1892] 

(61 L. J. Q. B. 449; (1892) 1 Q. B. 599; 66 L. T, 556 ; 56 J. P. 

436—0. A.) 

In an action brought by the plaintiffs as payees of a joint and 
several promissory note made by the defendant to recover a 
balance due upou the note, the jury found that at the time the 
defendant made the note he was insane and incapable of under- 
standing the contract, but they were unable to agree as to 
whether the plaintiffs at the tune knew of the defendant's 
insanity. 



REALITY OF CONSENT. 67 

Held, by the Court of Appeal, upon these findings, there 
must be a new trial. 

A part// to a contract cannot avoid a contract on the 
//round of his insanity at the time he entered into it, unless 
his insanity was at the time known to the other contracting 
party. The burden of proving both the insanity and the 
knowledge of it by the other contracting party lies upon the 
party seeking to avoid the contract. 



REALITY OF CONSENT. 



In the absence of Negligence, a Contract induced by Fraud is void 
even against an innocent third party. Where the Signature 
to a Negotiable Instrument is obtained by Fraud, and there 
has been no Negligence, the Negotiable Instrument is void 
even as against a holder in due course. 

LEWIS- v. CLAY. [1898] 
(67 L. J. Q. B. 224 ; 77 L. T. 653 ; 46 W. E. 319.) 

The defendant, who had just come of age, joined an Ascot 
House party. Lord William Neville, whom the defendant had 
known intimately for some years, was also a member of the 
same party. One evening Lord William Neville went to the 
defendant's bedroom and asked him to witness some deed or 
document. Lord William Neville produced a roll of papers 
covered up by blotting or other paper in which there were four 
openings. Upon the defendant asking what the documents 
were about, Lord William Neville said he would show them if 
the defendant insisted, but he would rather not, as it was a 
private matter, that he wanted a power of attorney, and that it 
had to do with his sister's marriage settlement, and certain 
divorce proceedings then pending. The defendant, trusting to 
Lord William Neville, whose honour he had no reason to doubt, 
then signed his name four times, and Lord William Neville 

f2 



68 CONTRACT. 

signed twice in the openings. He said he signed his name with 
the sole intention of witnessing the signature of Lord William 
Neville. It subsequently appeared that the documents signed 
by the defendant were promissory notes. In an action upon 
the promissory notes by the plaintiff, who obtained them in 
good faith and for value, the jury found tbe defendant had not 
been guilty of negligence. 

Held, the defendant wax not liable, as it was a contract 
ivhich had been induced by fraud, and as there had, been no 
negligence upon his part in signing the document, he ivas 
not estopped in an action brought against him upon the 
note by the payee of the note from relying upon the true 
facts as a defence, and -well facts afforded an answer to 
the action. 

Held also, the payee of a promissory note is not a " holder 
in due course " within the meaning of sect. 29 of the Bills 
of Exchange Act, and even if he had been he would not, upon 
the facts stated above, have been entitled to recover. 



Mistake as to person with whom the Contract is made known to 
that person avoids the contract. 

CUNDY v. LINDSAY. [1878] 
(47 L.J. Q. B. 481 ; 3 App. Cas. 459 ; 38L.T. 573; 26 W. R. 406.) 

Goods were supplied by Lindsay to one Blenkarn, who had 
taken premises at 37, Wood Street, and in ordering the goods 
had signed his name in such a way as to induce Lindsay to 
believe that he was a member of a well-known firm of Blenk- 
iron &amp; Sous, in Wood Street. For tbis fraud Blenkarn was 



REALITY OF CONSENT. 69 

tried and convicted of obtaining goods under false pretences. 
Before hiss conviction, Candy had honestly bought the goods in 
question from him and had sold them again. In an action by 
the plaintiffs Lindsay &amp; Co. for conversion of the goods — 

Held, that the property in the goods did not pass from 
the plain tiff's, who were consequently entitled to recover their 
value from the defendants. 

The jurors having in substance found that Blenkarn had 
led, and intended to lead, the plaintiffs to believe, and they 
did believe, that the person with whom they were communi- 
cating was not Blenkarn, the dishonest and irresponsible, 
but was a well-known and solvent house of Blenkiron Sf Co., 
doing business in the same street, how is it possible that 
in that state of things any contract could have arisen 
between Lindsay and Blenkarn, the dishonest man ? Of 
him they knew nothing, and of hint they never thought. 
With him they never intended to deal. Their minds never 
even for an instant rested upon him, and as between him 
and them there was no consensus of mind which could lead 
to any agreement or any contract whatever. As between 
him and them there -was merely the one side to a contract, 
where in order to produce a contract two sides would be 
required. That being so, it is idle to talk of property 
passing. The property remained as it originally had been, 
the property of Lindsay, and the title which was attempted 
to be given to Gundy was a title ivliich could not be given 
to him. 



70 CONTRACT. 

Parties must be ad idem, otherwise no Binding Contract is created. 
Parol Evidence may be given to explain a latent ambiguity. 

EAFFLES v. WICHELHAUS and another. [18(54] 
(33 L. J. Ex. 160 ; 2 H. &amp; C. 90G.) 

The defendants agreed to purchase goods " to arrive ex 
Peerless from Bombay," and in doing so had in their minds 
a boat of the same name, leaving Bombay in October. The 
plaintiffs, however, meant the Peerless that left in December, 
so the two parties were not ad idem-. Parol evidence was given 
to explain this latent ambiguity. 

Held, no contract, as the parties were not ad idem. 



Mutual Mistake as to existence of Subject-Matter of Contract 
voids Contract. 

SCOTT v. COULSON. [1903] 
(72 L. J. Ch. 600 ; (1903) 2 Ch. 249 ; 88 L T. 653— C. A.) 

On March 19th, 1902, the plaintiff, by an agreement in writing 
agreed to sell to the defendants for 460/. a policy of assurance 
on the life of A. J. Death. The agreement was completed by 
an assignment dated April 19, 1902. The assured had died in 
December, 1899, though at the date of the contract for sale both 
parties believed him to be alive. In the interval between the 
date of the contract and the completion, the defendants received 
information which led them to believe that the assured was dead 
at the date of the contract, but they did not disclose this 
information to the plaintiff. 

Ilelil, such a contract may be rescinded even after it has 
been com id, ted by assignment of the policy to the purchaser ', 
on the ground of mutual mistake 



REALITY OF CONSENT. 71 

At the date of the contract for sale of this policy both the 
parties to the contract supposed the assured to be alive, but 
as it turned out that this was a common mistake, the 
contract ivas one which could not be enforced. It is not 
necessary to have recourse to equity to rescind the contract if 
the basis which both parties recognised as the basis is not 
true. 



Where, by the Mistake of one Party, something is expressed in a 
Contract which that Party never intended to express, the 
Contract will be rescinded. 

PAGET v. MAESHALL. [1884]

49 J. P. 85.) 

The plaintiff granted a lease of certain premises to the defen- 
dant, and by mistake included a first floor which she intended 
to reserve. The defendant was not a party to the mistake. 

Held, that the lease must be rescinded, with an option to 
the defendant to lake the premises excluding the first floor. 
In cases of mutual mistake the Court grants relief by way 
of rectification ; but in cases of unilateral mistake by way of 
rescission, giving the other party the option of rectification. 



Money paid under Mistake of Fact is recoverable. 

In re BODEGA CO., LTD. [1904] 

(73 L. J. Ch. 198; (1904 1 Ch. 276; 89 L. T. 694; 52 W. E. 249;

A director vacated his office automatically by bargaining for 
a secret commission on the sale of certain property to the com- 



72 CONTRACT. 

pany, and continued to act and to receive his fees as director. 
He was subsequently re-elected to office in the ordinary course 
on his supposed retirement by rotation. At the time of this re- 
election the sale in question was completed with the exception 
of the payment of the secret commission, for which the director 
had a lien. 

Held, the company was entitled to recover these fees. 
Services rendered do not amount to a legal consideration 
unless then have been rendered in response to some request 
explicit or implied by law. The acceptance of services 
rendered is a prima facie ground for implying at law a 
request; but the Court is at liberty to resist this prima 
facie inference if warranted by the peculiar circumstances 
of the case. 

That although the director during the period between his 
vacating his office and his re-election had rendered services 
to the company ivhich had been accepted by them, yet, inas- 
much as it teas impossible for the Court /&lt;&gt; believe that the 
company would ever have requested him to render these 
services had they been aware of the true state of the facts, 
the Court could not imply a request for these services on the 
part of the company from the mere fact of their ignorant 
acceptance of them, and accordingly that the serv-ices ren- 
dered did not amount to a legal consideration for the fees 
i mid for /hem, and that the company was therefore entitled 
to recover these fees as money had and received. 



REALITY OF CONSENT. ~'6 

Money paid under Mistake of Law cannot be recovered unless 
there is some equitable ground which makes it inequitable

ROGERS v. INGHAM. [1876J

John Ingham having died leaving an ambiguous will, the 
executor took counsel's opinion as to the meaning of certain 
bequests. The opinion of counsel being adverse to that of one 
of the legatees, he also took the opinion of counsel, who advised 
in exactly the same way as the other had done. Acting upon 
these opinions the executor divided the moneys. Two years 
Inter the dissatisfied legatee filed a bill against the executor and 
the other legatees, submitting that the will had not been pro- 
perly construed, and claiming repayment from the other 
legatees. 

Heir/, the plaintiff was not entitled to succeed, for although 
the Court has power to relieve against mistakes in law as 
well as against mistakes in fact, the Court will only relieve 
where there is any equitable ground which makes it, under 
the particular facts of the case, inequitable that tin- party 
who received the money should retain it. 



An Innocent Misrepresentation is a good ground for Rescission of 
a Contract, but not for Damages for Deceit, for if a representa- 
tion is made in the honest belief that it is true, it is a good 
answer to an action for Deceit. There is no such thing as 
Constructive Fraud, but fraud must be proved. Motive of 
person guilty of fraud is immaterial.

The directors of a tramway company issued a prospectus stating 
that the company had, by its special Act of Parliament, the 



74 CONTRACT. 

right to use steam power instead of horses. Authority was, 
in fact, given by the special Ad to use steam power, but only 
with the consent of the Hoard of Trade, which had not been 
obtained when the prospectus was issued. When making the 
statement the directors believed that the consent would follow 
as a matter of course if the tramways were properly constructed. 
The consent of the Board of Trade vvas subsequently refused. 
The company having failed, an action for deceit was brought 
ugainst the directors by a shareholder, who alleged that he had 
taken shares on the faith of the statement in the prospectus. 

Held, that the defendants were entitled to judgment, as 
this wns an action for deceit, and they had made the state- 
ment in the belief that it was true 

In an action for rescission it is sufficient to prove a mis- 
representation, and, however innocent it may have been, the 
contract ivill be rescinded. 

In an action of deceit, fraud mast be proved, and nothing 
short of that will suffice. 

fraud is proved when it is shown that a false /•(presenta- 
tion has been /node ( i j knowingly, or (ii) without belief in its 
truth, or (Hi) recklessly careless whether it be true or false, 
and the absence of reasonable grounds for a misrepresentation 
is merely evidence from which the conclusion may be drawn 
that the person making the misrepresentation did so without 
belief in its truth. To prevent a false statement being 
fraudulent there must always be an lamest belief in its truth, 
for one who knowingly alleges that which is false has obviously 
no such honest belief. If fraud be proved, the motive oj the 
person guilty of it is immaterial.

(26 L. T. 130 : L. R. 7 C. P. 65 : 20 \Y. R. 280 ; 1 Asp. M. C. 220.) 

The plaintiffs, wishing to insure their vessel, Clarendon, from 
Belize to Rendezvous Point back to Belize, thence to other 
ports, and finally to London, sent their clerk to the defendants 5 
offices. The clerk told the defendants' manager that the 
plaintiffs knew nothing about Rendezvous Point further than 
that they had that day received a letter from the captain of the 
ship in which the captain said of Rendezvous Point : "It is 
considered by the pilot here as good and safe anchorage and 
well sheltered. I have been out and seen the place and consider 
it quite safe." In point of fact the place was not a good and 
safe anchorage, and the ship was lost there in consequence. 
The j ury found that the captain honestly entertained the opinion 
he had expressed. 

Held, the expressions contained in the captain's letter did 
not amount to an absolute statement of fact, but a mere 
matter of opinion honestly formed, which did not amount to 
a misrepresentation by the assured to vitiate the policy.

The Georgia, a ship well known in England on account of 
its exploits as a Confederate cruiser, was purchased by the 
plaintiff, who got her registered as a British vessel, and sent to 
an insurance broker an order to insure her, and a slip contain- 
ing accurate particulars of the name of the vessel, the place 
where she was built, her captain, tonnage, and charter, but 



76 CONTRACT. 

omitting to mention that she had been in the Confederate 
service. The defendant, after seeing the ship, and without 
knowing she was the former Confederate cruiser, underwrote 

her. The vessel having 1 n seized by the Government of the 

United States, the jury, in an action on the policy, found that 
the defendant was not aware of the fact that the Georgia 
was the Eormer Confederate cruiser, but that he had abundant 
means of identifying the ship at the time of underwriting her 
from information to be found in the slip itself. 

Held, the contract being our of uberrima jidei, the non- 
disclosure of a material fact afforded a good defence, for 
the assured was not entitled to rely on the recollection of 
the underwriter and the chance of his making further 

inquiry.

of over 900/. Three months after taking over the business the 
plaintiff brought this action for the rescission of the contract, 
alleging misrepresentation by concealment but not alleging 
fraud. 

Held, the Court will not grant rescission of an executed 
contract for the sale of a chattel or chose in action on the 
ground of an innocent Misrepresentation. 



REALITY OF CONSENT. 77 

In order for the plaintiff to succeed in such a case fraud 
must be proved. 

.In the absence of fraud a contract of this kind is not void 
hut voidable only, and it was tht duty of the plaintiffs 
bearing in mind the peculiar nature of lite property, to re- 
pudiate the contract at the very earliest possible moment 
when he found out that any misrepresentation had been made, 
if in fact any was made. 



The maxim Caveat Emptor applies to Sale of Goods. Non- dis- 
closure is not Fraud except in Contracts uberrimse fidei. 

WARD v. HOBBS. [1878] 

(48 L. J. Q. B. 281 ; 4 App: Cas. 13 ; 3 Q. B. I). 150 : 40 L. T. 73 ; 

27 W. R 114.) 

The defendant sent pigs which were to his knowledge infected 
with a contagious disease for sale to a public market ^which is 
an offence under sect. 57 of the Contagious IHseases (Animals) 
Act, 1&gt;69). The pi^s were sold subject to an expivss condition 
that no warranty would be given. The plaintiff bought the 
pigs, which infected other pigs in his possession, causing him 
great loss and expense. In an action for breach of an implied 
warranty and false representation that they were free from any 
contagious di&gt;* ase — 

Held, the defendant was not liable, for, at all events, 
//dan they are sold subject to an ci / ress condition that //&gt;&gt; 
warranty ivill be given, the mere act of exposing the pigs for 
sale in a public market was no evidence of an implied repre- 
sentation by the defendant that they were free from infection, 
or that he did not know titan to be infected. 

Purchasers are not within the purview of the above Act,

and cannot in consequence maintain an action upon a viola- 
tion oj the duty imposed by that section. 



A person who induces another to act on a Wilful Misrepresentation 
is estopped from denying its truth. 

FEEEMAN v. COOKE. [1848] 
(18 L. J. Ex. 1 14 ; 2 Ex. 654 ; 12 Jur. 777.) 

William Broadbent, being in expectation of an execution 
issuing against himself, removed his goods to the house of his 
brother, Benjamin Broadbent. "When the sheriff's officer 
entered the house of Benjamin Br &gt;adbent, William Broadbent 
(apparently supposing he had a writ against himself) gave him 
notice not to seize the goods, as they were the property of 
Benjamin. The officer produced Ins writ, which was against 
Benjamin. Then William Broadbent said the goods belonged to 
another brother, and finally that they belonged to himself. The 
officer seized and sold them as the goods of Benjamin before the 
bankruptcy of William Broadbent. 

In an action in trover by the assignees of William Broadbent, 
who had been made bankrupt — 

Ili'ld. th" bankrupt was estopped from denying the truth 
of the representation, for where a person wilfully makes a 
representation intended to induce another to act upon the 
faith &lt;&gt;f it, or where [whatever be his intention) a reasonable 
man in the situation of Unit other would believe that if was 
meant that he should act upon it as true and niter* his 
position, there is an estoppel in pais to conclude the former 
from averring against tin 1 latter a different state of things 
os existing at the some time ; and conduct by negligence or 
omission, where then is a duty cast upon tin- person to dis- 
close the I rulli, may often hove the same effect. But unless 



REALITY OF CONSENT. 79 

the statement tvas intended to induce the other to act on the 
faith of it, or was such thai a reasonable person ivould act 
on the faith of it, there is no estoppel, although the other 
did in fact believe the statement, and, was in fact induced to 
alter his position accordingly. 



In action for Fraud it is necessary to show that Deceit did actually 

deceive. 

AHKWEIGHT v. NEWBOLD. [1881] 
(50 L. J. Ch. .'372 ; 17 Ch. D. 301 ; 44 L. T. 393 ; 29 W. R. 455.) 

The prospectus issued by the promoters of a projected com- 
pany stated that the purchase-money to be paid to the vendors 
was 32,000/. (of which 15,000/. was to be paid in fully-paid 
shares), and that "' the remuneration of the directors will be paid 
by the shareholders, and it is proposed that they should be paid 
only by a commission on the profits made, no promotion money 
whatever being paid to them by the company, and all formation 
expenses being paid by the vendors." The vendors of the 
business, who became directors, received part payment in shares 
and transferred 800 of these shares (being of the nominal value 
of 4,000/.) to the directors others than the vendors. The 
factor which decided the plaintiff to take shares was seeing 
the name of Mr. Grrimes in the prospectus, for he had great 
faith in that gentleman's astuteness and th &gt;ught he would know 
if it was a profitable concern. 

Held, the prosper lux dia not contain any misstatement on 
which an action for deceit could be, grounded. In order to 
maintain an action for fraud it is necessary to prove that 
the plaintiff was actually deceived by the deceit, and this 
was not so in the present case, as the inducement Jor the 
plaintiff to become a shareholder was his faith in the shrewd- 
ness of Mr. Gnmes, who was one of the directors. 



80 CONTRACT. 

Court will not give Relief under the Moneylenders Act, 1900, on 
the Ground that the Contract is "harsh and unconscionable/' 
merely because the Interest is high. 

CAKRINGTONS, LTD. v. SMITH. [1906] 

(75 L. -T. K. B. 49; (1906) 1 K. B. 79; 93 L. T. 779: 54 W. R. 124; 

22 T. L. R. 109.) 

The defendant was a director of a publishing company, by 
which, together with salary and commission, he was paid 1,000/. 
per annum. The furniture in his house was worth about 3,000/., 
and he had pictures which he estimated as being worth 6,000/. 
The defendant being temporarily in need of some ready money, 
got tlit- plaintiffs to advance him 10' 7., and gave them a promissory 
note for 150/., payable by twelve monthly instalments of 12/. 10s. 
each. The promissory note contained a clause that on default 
in payment of any instalment the whole was to become due. 
The defendant paid seven of these instalments, and default 
having been made in the payment of an instalment the plaintiffs 
sued for the balance of 62/. 10-s. The defendant claimed relief 
under the Moneylenders Act, 1900. 

Held, such a transaction was not harsh and unconscionable 
so as to entitle the defendant to relief. The Court, when 
asked to reopen a mon^y lending transaction under sect. 10 
of the Moneylenders Act, 1900, on the ground of excessive 
interest charged by the lender, is entitled to consider amongst 
- all the circumstances" the fact that the borrower thoroughly 
understood the transaction, and without any representation 
or pressure, other than the mere request I" pay so much 
interest, voluntarily agreed to pay it ; and when the Court 
finds these to be the facts it ought to hdd that the interest 
which the borrower agreed to pay is reasonable and not 
excessive within the meaning of the Act. 

In considering the "risk" incurred by the moneylender 



LEGALITY OF OBJECT. 81 

in making an advance, it is not the real risk as ascertained 
after the event which has to be looked at, but how the matter 
presented itself to the moneylender at the time he made the 
advance, with the experience he ivould have of borrowers.

EGEETON v. BROWNLOW. [1853] 
(23 L. J. Ch. 348 ; 4 H. L. C. 1 ; 1 Sim. (N. S.) 464 ; 18 Jur. 71.) 

The seventh Earl of Bridgewater left by will certain estates 
to Lord Alford, with the proviso that if Lord Alford died with- 
out having acquired the title of Duke or Marquis of Bridge- 
water they should go over. Lord Alford never obtained either 
title. 

Held, that the estates went to the heir of Lord Alford, 
as such a condition ivas void as being against public policy, 
being " a direct and powerful temptation to the exercise 
of corrupt means of obtaining the particular dignity" and 
an inducement to obtain distinction for which the person 
might be unworthy, and, further, it ivas a capricious con- 
dition, tvhich the common laiv hates. 



Simony is illegal by 31 Eliz. c. 6. 
MOSSE v. KILLICK. [1881] 
(50 L. J. Q. B. 300 ; 44 L. T. 149 ; 29 W. E. 522.) 

The plaintiff, who was incumbent and patron of a living, put 
the rectory into repair, and, with the sanction of the bishop of 
the diocese, let it to a tenant for a certain period. Before the 

J. Q 



82 CONTRACT. 

termination of the tenancy the plaintiff resigned the living and 
presented the defendant thereto. The presentation was made 
upon an understanding and agreement between the plaintiff 
and the defendant that the defendant should, in consideration 
of having received the benefit of the said repairs, hand over to 
the plaintiff any rent which he should receive in respect of the 
said tenancy between the date of the presentation and the 
termination of the tenancy. 

The presentation having been made, the defendant refused to 
pay the amount of rent he had received from the tenant on the 
ground that the agreement was simoniacal and therefore void. 

Held, this was a simoniacal agreement, and the pre- 
sentation was, therefore, void under -'il Eliz. c. 6. 

Note. — 31 Eliz. c. 6, s. 5, for the avoiding of simony, directs that 
the corrupt presentation shall be void, and the presentation shall go 
to the Crown. 



Money won by an Agent on behalf of his Principal in a Gaming 
Transaction is recoverable by the Principal. 

DE MATTOS v. BENJAMIN. [1894] 
(63 L. J. Q. B. 248 ; 10 E. 103 ; 70 L. T. 500 ; 42 W. R. 284.) 

In August, 1893, the plaintiff employed the defendant to 
make bets for him as his agent. The agent was successful, and 
there was a balance of over 15/. due to the plaintiff. This 
amount, however, the defendant refused to part with on the 
ground that the transaction was within the Gaming Act, 
1892 (1), and 8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. 109, and therefore no action could 
be brought to recover the money. 

Held, the operation of the Gaming Acts does not dis- 
entitle a principal to recover from his agent the amount of 
bets toon and received.

Money in the hands of a Stakeholder can be recovered by the 
Depositor before payment over. 

BUEGE v. ASHLEY &amp; SMITH, Ltd. [1900] 

(69 L. J. Q. B. 538 ; (1900) 1 Q. B. 744 ; 82 L. T. 518 ; 
48 W. E. 438.) 

The plaintiff and Dobbs each deposited the sum of '300/. with 
the proprietors of " The Sportsman " to abide the result of a 
boxing match between the plaintiff and Dobbs. Dobbs won 
the match, but the plaintiff gave the defendant notice not to 
pay the stake over to Dobbs. The defendants took no heed of 
this notice, but paid over the stakes to Dobbs. In an action to 
recover the amount deposited by the plaintiff — 

Held, the Gaming Act, 1892, tvhich provides that no 
action shall be maintained to recover any sum of money 
paid by any 'person under or in respect of any contract or 
agreement rendered null and void by the Gaming Act, 
1845 — that is, any contract or agreement, ivhether by parol 
or in writing, by way of gaming or ivagering — does not 
apply to a deposit of money with a stakeholder so as to 
prevent the depositor maintaining an action against the 
stakeholder for the recovery of a deposit ivhich he has 
demanded back from the stakeholder before it ivas paid 
over by him.

84 CONTRACT. 

Money Lent to make a Wager cannot be recovered. 
CARNEY v. PLIMMEB. [1897] 

(66 L. J. Q. B. 415 ; (1897) 1 Q. B. 634 ; 76 L. T. 374 ; 
45 W. E. 385 ; 61 J. P. 324— C. A.) 

The defendant, who had agreed to fight a boxing match with 
a man named Corfield for stakes to be deposited with a stake- 
holder by himself and Corfield, requested the plaintiff to lend him 
the money for his stake. The plaintiff advanced the money, 
which was to be repaid if the defendant won the match, but was 
not to be repaid if he lost. The money was deposited with the 
stakeholder. The defendant won the match and received the 
stake, but refused to pay the plaintiff, who brought an action 
to recover the money advanced as money lent. 

Held, that the money was paid by the plaintiff in respect 
of a contract rendered null and void by the Gaming Act, 
1845 (8 fy 9 Vict. c. 109), ivithin the meaning of sect. 1 of 
the Gaming Act, 1892, and the action could not be main- 
tained. 



Money paid in discharge of Gaming Debt of another is not recover-

TATHAM p. EEEVE. [1893] 

(62 L. J. Q. B. 30 ; (1893) 1 Q. B. 44 ; 5 E. 83 ; 67 L. T. 683 ; 
41 W. E. 174; 57 J. P. 118.) 

The defendant asked the plaintiff to pay a certain account for 
him, as he was in a hurry to get to Henley. The plaintiff paid 
the amount (148/.) as requested. The money was to satisfy bets 
lost by the defendant. An action was brought to recover the 
amount. 

Held, money paid to satisfy bets at the request of a third 
party cannot be recovered, even though the person paying 



LEGALITY OF OBJECT. 85 

is ignorant of the purpose for which the money is paid. 
It is money paid in respect of a wagering contract, and its 
recovery is prohibited by the Gaming Act o/1892. 



A Bill of Exchange given in payment of a Wager would be given 
for no Consideration, and could not therefore be sued upon by 
original holder ; but a subsequent holder could sue, as a Wager 
is not illegal but void, unless the Acceptor could prove that 
he gave no value for it. 

FITCH v. JONES. [1855] 

(24 L. J. Q. B. 293 ; 5 El. &amp; Bl. 238 ; 1 Jur. (N. S.) 854 ; 
3 W. E. 507.) 

Mr. Needkam and the defendant having made a wager on 
the hop duty, the defendant lost, and, in satisfaction of the debt, 
made a promissory note in favour of Needkam payable two 
months after date. Needham endorsed the note to Taylor, and 
Taylor in his turn endorsed the note to the plaintiff. The 
defendant refused to pay the note on the ground that it was 
given in payment of a wager, and could not be sued upon. 

Held, a promissory note given in payment of a wager 
constitutes, as between the maker and payee, a mere nudum 
pactum, which cannot be sued upon for ivant of considera- 
tion. But there being a mere want of consideration in the 
inception of the note under 8 6f 9 Vict. c. 107, and no ille- 
gality and fraud, the onus is on the maker of the note to 
show that the plaintiff took it without value, and as he coidd 
not show that, the plaintiff succeeded. 



86 CONTRACT. 

Transactions to pay Differences where there is no intention to 
purchase are Gaming Transactions and void, even though the 
Contract contains an Option to Buy or Sell. 

UNIVERSAL STOCK EXCHANGE, Ltd. v. STRACHAN. [1896] 

(65 L. J. Q. B. 429 ; (1896) A. C. 166 ; 74 L. T. 468 ; 44 W. R. 

497 ; 60 J. P. 468 ; 59 J. P. 789— C. A.) 

The plaintiff (Strachan) was engaged in speculating in differ- 
ences with the defendants, the Universal Stock Exchange, Ltd., 
who were stockjobbers. There never was any intention to pur- 
chase the stocks, and none were in fact taken up. There was, 
however, a term in the contract by which either party had the 
option to compel the stocks to be delivered and received. The 
plaintiff having omitted to deposit further cover at the request 
of the defendants, the latter, before the usual account day, closed 
the account, when it appeared that a balance was due to the 
defendants in excess of the securities in their hands. The 
plaintiff thereupon demanded the return of his securities, and 
failing to obtain them, brought this action for their return, on the 
ground that the transactions were transactions of gaming and 
wagering, and thereupon null and void under sect. 18 of the 
Gaming Act, 1845. 

The jury found that the transactions were gaming transactions. 

Held, the plaintiff was entitled to recover the securities. 
Securities deposited by a customer as u cover" for any 
balance which might, be found to be due from him to the 
stockjobbers are not u deposited to abide the event on which 
any wager should have been made " within the meaning of 
that section., and the customer is not precluded from main- 
taining an action for their recovery. The insertion of such 
a provision in the contract as above referred to, though in- 
serted by way of creating an obligation, being only to cloak 
the fact that it was a gambling transaction that the parties 



LEGALITY OF OBJECT. 87 

were entering into, will not prevent the transaction from 
being treated as a gaming transaction when, as in this case, 
it is of that nature. 

Agreements to stifle Criminal Proceedings are invalid where the 
offence is of a Public Nature, but are valid where the offence 
is of a Private Nature. 

KEIR v. LEEMAN. [1846] 
(15 L. J. Q. B. 360 ; 10 Jur. 742 ; 9 Q. B. 371. 

The plaintiff, who was about to prosecute the defendant and 
others for an assault and riot, promised to proceed no further 
with the prosecution if the defendant paid him a certain sum of 
money. The defendant agreed, and the plaintiff accordingly, 
with the consent of the Court, offered no evidence at the trial. 
The defendant, however, refused to pay the amount agreed, and 
on being sued — 

Held, the law will permit the compromise of offences, 
although made the subject of criminal prosecution, for which 
the injured 'party might sue and recover damages in an 
action ; but no agreement can be valid which is founded upon 
the consideration of stifling an offence of a public matter, 
even though that offence {which was in this case riot) be 
coupled with an offence not of a public nature (in this case 
a common assault), and therefore the plaintiff ivas not 
entitled to recover. 



Champerty is illegal. 

EEES v. DE BERNARDY. [1896] 
(65 L. J. Ch. 656 ; (1896) 2 Ch. 437 ; 74 L. T. 585.) 

The defendant, who was a next of kin agent, discovered that 
two elderly women in humble life and illiterate were the 



88 CONTRACT. 

heiresses-at-law of a person who had died intestate in New 
Zealand, entitled to property there to the value of some 
thousands of pounds. The defendant insisted, as the only terms 
on which he would tell them the particulars of the property and 
recover it for them, that they should give him half the property 
recovered. 

Held, a contract to communicate information on terms of 
getting a share of any property tvhich may be recovered by 
the person to whom the information is given is not in itself 
champerty ; but if the contract provides further that the 
person who gives the information, and tvho is to share in 
what may be recovered, shall himself recover the property 
or actively assist in the recovery of it by procuring evidence 
or similar means, then the contract is contrary to the policy 
of the law and void. The contract, being one of champerty , 
was therefore void. 



Marriage Brocage Contracts are illegal, and money paid there- 
under is recoverable. 

HEEMANN v. CHAELESWOETH. [1905] 
(74 L. J. K. B. 620 ; (1905) 2 K. B. 123 ; 95 L. T. 284 ; 54 W. E, 

22; 21 T. L. E. 368— C. A.) 

The plaintiff entered into an agreement with the defendant 
by which the defendant undertook to assist the plaintiff to get 
married, and in pursuance of the agreement the plaintiff paid 
to the defendant 52/., of which 47/. was to be returned in 
nine months if no marriage or engagement took place within 
that period. The defendant introduced the plaintiff to, and put 
her in communication with, a number of gentlemen with a view 
to marriage, but no marriage or engagement had resulted when, 
before the expiration of the nine months, the plaintiff repudiated 



LEGALITY OF OBJECT. 89 

the contract and brought an action for the return of the money 
paid. 

Held, that the agreement was an illegal marriage brocage 

contract, and that the plaintiff ivas entitled to recover the 

money she had paid to the defendant in pursuance thereof, 

as no part of the illegal purpose, which was the bringing 

about of the marriage, had been carried out. 



Agreements in Total Restraint of Marriage are not binding. 

LOWE v. PEEES. [1768] 

(4 Burr. 2225 ; Wilmot, 304.) 

The defendant executed a deed to the following effect : "I 
do hereby promise Mrs. Catherine Lowe that I will not marry 
with any person besides herself ; if I do I agree to pay to the 
said Catherine Lowe 1,000/. within three months next after I 
shall marry anybody else." 

The defendant proved unfaithful and married one Elizabeth 
Gardiner. Thereupon the plaintiff brought this action. 

Held, this was not a promise by the defendant to marry 
the plaintiff, but to marry no one else but the plaintiff, so 
that if the plaintiff refused him he could marry no one at 
all. Such a promise ivas, therefore, in total restraint of 
marriage, and not binding, as encouraging immorality and 
tending to depopulation. 



Agreements as to future Separation are bad, but as to present 
Separation, are good. 

CAETWEIGHT v. CAET WEIGHT. [1858] 
(22 L. J. Ch. 841 ; 17 Jur. 584 ; 1 W. E. 245.) 

A father, upon the marriage of his eon, settled real estate 
upon the intended husband and wife. The settlement contained 



90 CONTRACT. 

a proviso that in case of a separation between husband and wife 
by reason of any disagreement or otherwise, the interest given 
to the wife should, during the joint lives of herself and her 
husband, belong to him alone. 

Held, that this proviso was in contemplation of a future 
separation, and was therefore bad. 

Note. — Agreements in contemplation of immediate separation 
are valid. 



Contracts in Restraint of Trade may be Partial or General, but 
must be Reasonable, and in no way injurious to the Public. 

NORDENFELT v. MAXIM-NORDENEELT GUN Co., Ltd. 

[1894] 
(63 L. J. Ch. 908; (1894) A. C. 535 ; 71 L. T. 489; 11 E, 1.) 

The defendant Nordenfelt sold his business to the company 
for a large sum of money and covenanted that for twenty-five 
years he would not be concerned in the manufacture of guns, 
explosives, &amp;c, or in the carrying on of any business competing 
or liable to compete with the business of the company. Such 
restrictions were not, however, to apply to the manufacture of 
torpedoes and other submarine objects. This action was brought 
to enforce this covenant. 

Held, the contract was enforceable and not contrary to 
public jiolicy or ivider than tvas reason/ddg required lor I lie 
protection of the jdaintiffs. The true test in all cases, 
whether of partial or general restraint of trade, is whether 
the restraint is reasonable, i.e., whether it affords adequate 
protection to the party in tvhose favour it is imposed tvithout 
being wider titan is reasonably necessary for his protection, 
ivhile at the same time it is in no way injurious to the public. 



LEGALITY OF OBJECT. 91 

Where part of the Contract is illegal, the whole Contract is not 
vitiated if that part be severable. 

PICKERING v. THE ILFEACOMBE RAIL. CO. [1868] 
(37 L.J. C. P. 118; L. R. 3 0. P. 235; 17 L. T. 650; 16 W. E. 458.) 

The defendants in February, 1865, obtained judgment for 
10,500/. against the Devon and Somerset Railway, which was 
not satisfied at the date of this action. In June, 1866, the 
Devon and Somerset Railway owed a sum of 40,000/. to the 
plaintiffs, who were engaged on the construction of the line. 
In order to meet the claims of the plaintiffs, the Devon and 
Somerset Railway on the 11th June, 1866, made a call on their 
shareholders of 5/. per share payable on or before the 16th July, 
and assigned the result of these calls, by way of mortgage, as a 
security for their debt to the plaintiffs. The mortgage deed 
gave the mortgagees a power of sale. The question was whether 
the mortgage was effective. 

Held, that even if the power of sale was bad as being 
ultra vires the Devon and Somerset Railway, yet that 
potver can be separated from the rest of the deed, and should 
not therefore be allowed to vitiate the useful part of the deed 
by its presence, for the common law is like a nursing father, 
which makes void only that which is bad and retains what 
is good. The general rule is that where you cannot sever 
the illegal from the legal part of a covenant, the contract is 
altogether void, but where you can sever them, whether the 
illegality be created by statute or by the common law, you 
may reject the bad part and retain the good. 

The power of sale, therefore, being separable from the rest 
of the contract, the rest is good. 



92 CONTRACT. 

Security under seal for payments prohibited by Statute is void. 

FISHER v. BRIDGES. [1854] 

(24 L. J. Q. 13. 165 ; 3 E. &amp; B. 642 ; 2 C. L. R. 928 ; 1 Jur. N. S. 
157 ; 1 W. E. 350.) 

The plaintiff sold to the defendant certain lands, as the jury 
found, to the intent and for the purpose of its being sold by 
the defendant by lottery. The defendant made a part payment 
and covenanted by deed to pay the balance. On his refusal 
to pay the balance this action was brought. 

Held, the defendant was entitled to judgment, as the 
original contract to sell the land for the purposes of a 
lottery zvas void by 12 Geo. 2, c. 28, s. 4, and being 
illegal could not be enforced. So, too, where a bond or other 
instrument is connected with the illegal agreement it cannot 
be enforced. 

Held also, that there was no analogy between this action 
and an action on a bond for past cohabitation, for that is 
not an illegal consideration but no consideration at all, 
and inasmuch as an instrument under seal is good without 
consideratio?i, a bond for maintenance founded on past 
cohabitation and previous seduction is good. But if an 
agreement had been made to pay a sum of money in con- 
sideration of future cohabitation, and after cohabitation the 
money had been unpaid, and the bond given to secure that 
money, Hint would be the same case as this, and such a 
bond could not under such circumstances be enforced.

The plaintiff effected a policy of insurance upon the life of 
his mother in consequence of a statement made by the agent of 
the defendants, without fraud, that the policy was a good one. 
The plaintiff brought this action to recover back the premiums 
paid under the policy on the ground that it was illegal and void. 

Held, that, assuming that the policy was illegal and void 
by reason of the plaintiff having no insurable interest in 
the life insured, the innocent misstatement of law by the 
agent, in the absence of proof of fraud, duress, oppression, 
or such a difference in the position of the parties as would 
create a fiduciary relationship between them, did not displace 
the rule of law that, where one of two parties to &lt;m illegal 
contract pays money to the other in pursuance thereof, 
he cannot recover it back. 



An Agreement, innocent in itself, is void if in aid of an illegal 

object. 

PEARCE v. BROOKES. [1866] 

(35 L. J. Ex. 134 ; L. R, 1 Ex. 213 ; 12 Jur. (N. S.) 342 ; 
14 L. T. 288; 14 W. R. 614.) 

The plaintiff, having lent a miniature brougham to the defen- 
dant on the hire-purchase system, the defendant returned the 
brougham before she had paid up all the instalments. On being 
sued for damages for breach of contract the defendant pleaded 



94 CONTRACT. 

that the plaintiffs knew that she was a prostitute, and that the 
hire of the brougham was to enable her to carry on her immoral 
vocation in better style. 

Held, the 'plaintiff was not entitled to recover, as the 
brougham had been lent to promote an illegal /impose. 



Past illicit cohabitation is no Consideration. 

BEAUMONT r. REEVE. [1846] 
(15 L. J. Q. B. 141 ; 8 Q. B. 483; 10 Jur. 284.) 

The defendant, on ceasing to cohabit with the plaintiff, agreed, 
in consideration of past cohabitation, to pay the plaintiff a 
yearly annuity of 60/. The defendant, however, never paid 
the annuity, and was accordingly sued therefor. 

Held, there was no consideration for the agreement, and 
that a precedent moral obligation, however strong, if the cir- 
cumstances are such as not to create any subsequent legal 
obligation, loill not raise an implied promise in law. 

Note. — Such a contract would be valid if under seal, as it is 
merely given for an unlawful l&gt;ut not an illegal purpose. See 
Fisher v. Bridges, supra, p. 92. 



Money paid under Unlawful Contract cannot be recovered except 
where unlawful purpose is not performed. 

TAYLOR v. BOVVERS. [1876] 

(46 L. J. Q. B. 39 ; 1Q.B. D. 291 ; 34 L. T. 938 ; 24 W. R. 
499— C. A.) 

The plaintiff, with the privity of the defendant, who was one 
of his creditors, assigned and delivered certain goods to one 
Alcock, in order to defeat his creditors generally. The 



LEGALITY OF OBJECT. 95 

defendant, without the knowledge of the plaintiff, obtained a 
bill of sale of the goods from Alcock, and under this bill of sale 
took possession of the goods. Before any fraud was accom- 
plished upon the creditors, the plaintiff claimed the goods from 
the defendant 

Held, Bowers was not a bona fide purchaser of I lie 
goods, as he knew that Alcock had no title to them, and that 
the plaintiff was entitled to recover the goods, for where 
money is paid or goods delivered for an illegal purpose, the 
person who had so delivered them mag recover them back 
before the illegal purpose is carried out, but if he waits till 
the illegal purpose is carried out, or if he seeks to recover 
by enforcing the illegal transaction, and to carry that out, 
then the law will not allow that to be done. In the present 
case this was not so, and the plaintiff did not require the 
aid of the illegal transaction, but was really bringing the 
action to set it aside. 



Contracts made abroad which are legal where made, and which 
are unlawful but not illegal in England, may be sued on 
here. 

SANTOS v. ILLIDGE. [1860] 

(29 L. J. 0. P. 348; 8 C. B. (N. S.) 861 ; 6 Jur. (N. S.) 1.348 ; 
3 L. T. 154 ; 8 W. E. 705— Ex. Ch.) 

The defendants, a company of British subjects domiciled in 
England, but working mines in Brazil, agreed to sell certain 
slaves to the plaintiff, a Brazilian resident, and domiciled in 
Brazil, where slavery was allowed. The slaves were acquired 
by the defendants in Brazil after the passing of the statute 
Greo. 4, c. 113, and before the passing of the statute 6 &amp; 7 
Vict. c. 98, s. 5. A large number of them were purchased. 



96 CONTRACT. 

The others were the children and offspring of those acquired by 
purchase. The defendants having refused to deliver the slaves 
this action was brought. 

Held, that the contract was legal and might be enforced 
in this country, on the ground that the statute 6 &amp;f 7 Vict, 
c. 98, s. 5, permitted the sale of slaves, the holding of whom 
ivas not prohibited by any Act of Parliament ; and that no 
statute prohibited the holding of the slaves in Brazil, even 
though the purchasing of them there might be felony in a 
British subject. 

Note. — 5 Geo. 4, c. 113, constituted the purchase of slaves by a 
British subject a felony. 



Where the Original Consideration for a Contract is unlawful, 
another and distinct Legal Consideration may be proved so as 
to establish a new Contract. 

HYAMS v. STUAET KING. [1908] 

(77 L. J. K. B. 794 ; (1908) 2 K. B. 696 ; 99 L. T. 424 ; 
24 T. L. R. 675— C. A.) 

The plaintiff, a bookmaker, had certain betting transactions 
with the defendant firm, which was carried on for the purpose 
of bookmaking. These transactions resulted in a balance of 
108/. 10s. being due to the plaintiff in respect of bets on horse 
races, and a cheque for that amount signed in the firm's name 
was given him. Subsequently a member of the firm requested 
him not to present the cheque for payment, as certain money 
expected by the firm had not arrived, and certain payments 
were made which reduced the above-mentioned sum to 48/. 10s. 
No further payments having been made, the plaintiff issued a 
writ against the firm, which was endorsed for 48/. 10s., balance 
due to him by the defendant firm on an account stated. The 
plaintiff" at the trial contended that the promise to pay had been 
based on some consideration other than that of the bets, such 



LEGALITY OF OBJECT. 97 

consideration being the holding over of the cheque by the plain- 
tiff at the request of the firm aud an agreement by him not to 
mention, and in fact not mentioning, the matter to other cus- 
tomers of the firm. 

Held, that such agreement constituted a neiv contract, the 
consideration for which was sufficient to support an action 
for the money claimed by the plaintiff. 



Insurable Interest at date of Insurance is essential, but need not 
continue till death of Assured. Life Assurance, unlike Marine 
or Fire Assurance, is not a Contract of Indemnity. 

LAW v. LONDON INDISPUTABLE LIFE POLICY CO. 

[1855] 

(24 L. J. Oh. 196 ; 3 Eq. E. 338 ; 1 Kay &amp; J. 223 ; 1 Jur. (N. S.) 
178; 3 VV. B. 154.) 

Thomas Law, being short of money, induced his father, the 
plaintiff, to lend him some on the strength of his being entitled 
to a reversionary interest on his attaining the age of thirty 
years. Thomas Law was then twenty-eight years of age, and 
the plaintiff, wishing to make certain of being repaid the money 
he had lent, insured his son's life for two years with the 
defendants. Thomas Law attained the age of thirty years on 
the 16th January, 1852, and thus became entitled to the rever- 
sionary interest. On the 22nd of the same month Thomas 
Law died, and the two years for which he was insured not 
having expired, the plaintiff claimed the insurance money. 
The defendants disputed the claim on the ground that the legacy 
to insure which the policy was effected had been paid to and 
received by the plaintiff, and his interest in the life of his son 
had thereby ceased ; and also on the ground that the policy 
was granted only as an indemnity to the plaintiff in case of his 
son dying under the age of thirty years. 

J. H 



98 CONTRACT. 

Held, an insurable interest in assured at. itate of assurance 
is essential under 14 Geo. 3, c. 48, s. 3, but a policy of assur- 
ance is not void by reason of the interest in the life assured 
ceasing before the expiration of the policy. 

Held also, a life assurance differs from fire or marine as- 
surance, inasmuch as it is not a contract of indemnity, but 
a contract to pay a certain definite sum at a future time in 
consideration of certain annual payments in the meantime. 



THE ASSIGNMENT OF CONTRACT. 

Rights and Liabilities under an Executory Contract cannot be 
assigned without the consent of the other party. An Agent 
who contracts in his own name for an Undisclosed Principal 
alone can sue on the Contract. 

HUMBLE v. HUNTER. [1848] 
(12 Q. B. 310 ; 17 L. J. Q. B. 350 ; 12 Jur. 121.) 

C. J. Humble, the son of the plaintiff, signed a charter-party 
which commenced as follows : — " It is this day mutually agreed 
between C. J. Humble, Esq., owner of the good ship or vessel 
called the Ann," &amp;c. An action was brought by the plaintiff, 
Mrs. Humble, who was the owner of the Ann, on this charter- 
party. 

Held, the plaintiff was not entitled to succeed, for the 
defendant had entered into the charter-party ivith C. J. 
Humble, ivho purported to be the owner of the Ann, ana 
could not therefore be liable to the plaintiff, with whom he 
had not contracted ; for where one party contracts zvith 
another party, each has a right to the benefit he contemplates 
from the character, credit and substance of the party with 



THE ASSIGNMENT OF CONTRACT. 99 

whom he contracts, and cannot be deprived of such benefit 
without his consent. 

Held also, that where a party appoints another to act for 
him, and the person so appointed contracts in his own name, 
without disclosing his principal, the principal cannot after- 
wards come in and, declare that the contract was for his 
benefit. 



An Absolute Assignment in writing of a Debt or other legal Chose 
in Action, express notice of which has been given to the 
Debtor, gives Assignee the absolute right to sue for same in 
his own name and deprives the Assignor of any rights. 

HUGHES v. PUMP HOUSE HOTEL CO. [1902] 
(71 L. J. K. B. 630 ; 2 K. B. 190 ; 86 L. T. 794 ; 50 W. E. 660— 

0. A.) 

The plaintiff, a builder, who had entered into a building con- 
tract with the defendants, executed an assignment in the follow- 
ing terms in favour of his bankers : — " In consideration of your 
continuing a banking account with me . . . and by way of 
continuing security to you for the money due to you from me 
... I hereby assign to you all moneys due or to become due 
to me from (the defendants) under or by virtue (of the said 
building contract). And I hereby empower you, on my behalf 
and in my name, to settle and adjust all accounts in connection 
with the works and matters aforesaid, to give effectual receipts 
for the moneys hereby assigned. . . . Also, if necessary, to sue for 
or take such steps as you may think necessary for enforcing pay- 
ment of the moneys hereby assigned. . . . And I hereby under- 
take, at your request and my cost, to do and execute all such 
further acts, deeds and things as you may reasonably require 
for giving- full effect to the security hereby created." Notice 
in writing of this assignment was given to the defendants in a 
letter addressed to them by the plaintiff, authorising and re- 
questing them to pay to Lloyds' Bank all moneys due to or to 

h2 



100 CONTRACT. 

become due under the eoutract referred to. Notwithstanding 
this assignment, the plaintiff claimed that the balance due by 
the defendants should be paid over to him, and on the defendants 
refusal brought this action. 

Held, that this was an "absolute assignment" within 
sect. 25, sub-sect. 6, of the Judicature Act, 1873. and that, 

therefore, the plaintiff was not entitled to sue the defendant 
in respect of the balance alleged to be due to him under the 

building contract. 

Bona fide Holder for Value of a Negotiable Instrument acquires 
a Good Title in spite of Defective Title of Person from whom 
he received it. 

THE LONDON JOINT STOCK BANK v. SIMMONS. [1892] 

(61 L. J. Ch. 723 ; (1892) A. C. 201 ; 66 L. T. 625 ; 

41 W. E. 108; 56 J. P. 644— H. L. (E.).j 

A broker was in the habit of pledging his customers' securities 
en bloc with the London Joint Stock Bank as security for 
advances to himself. He pledged, among others, certain mortgage 
bonds belonging to Simmons, which were transferable by delivery. 
The bankers had no notice, and no reason to suspect, that the 
broker had no right to pledge these bonds for his own purposes. 
The broker failed and absconded. 

Held, that the bonds being negotiable securities, and the 
bankers having acted in good faith and without notice of the 
broker's fraud, were entitled to retain and realise the bonds 
to repay themselves the money due by the broker, for the bona 
fide holder for value of negotiable instruments tvho receives 
them without notice of a defect in title of the person from 
whom he receives them acquires a good title to them notwith- 
standing the fraud or absence of title of the person from 
whom he received them. It is of the very essence of a 



THE ASSIGNMENT OF CONTRACT. 101 

negotiable instrument that you may treat the person in 
possession of it as having authority to deal with it, be he 
agent or otherwise, unless you knoiv to the contrary, and are 
not compelled, in order to secure a good title to yourself, to 
inquire into the nature of his title or the extent of his 
authority. 



Mercantile Usage has the effect of adding to class of Negotiable 

Securities. 

BECHUANALAND EXPLORATION CO. v. LONDON 
TRADING BANK. [1898] 

(67 L. J. Q. B. 986 ; 2 Q. B. 658 ; 79 L. T. 270.) 

The plaintiff company had a secretary named Evans, who was 
entrusted with the key of the company's safe in which the 
debentures were kept. Evans possessed himself of the deben- 
tures, and fraudulently pledged them with the defendants in the 
ordinary course of business to secure advances made by them to 
him personally. The defendants took the debentures from 
Evans in good faith. It was proved that there was a mercantile 
usage to treat as negotiable the debentures of an English 
company. 

Held, that the list of negotiable securities is not closed, 
and that where it is proved that there is a mercantile usage 
to treat as negotiable the debentures of an English company, 
the Court will give effect to such usage, not withstanding tint 
it may be of recent origin only, and that therefore the defen- 
dants tut re entitled to the debentures as being negotiable 
instruments transferable by delivery, notwithstanding the 
dejective title of the person from whom they had received them. 



102 CONTRACT. 

Loser of a Bill of Exchange or Promissory Note cannot recover on 
it unless he indemnifies payer against loss. 

THE CONFLANS STONE QUAEEY CO. v. PAEKEB. [1867] 

(37 L. J. C. P. 51 ; L. E, 3 0. P. 1 ; 17 L. T. 283 ; 16 W. E, 127.) 

The plaintiffs purchased from the National Bank, of which 
the defendant was the registered public officer, eight circular 
notes which were issued addressed to the bank's correspondents 
abroad. The name of Jean Baptiste Eimbeaux, an agent of 
the plaintiffs, was filled into the agent's circular notes as that of 
the person who was to get them cashed. The plaintiffs sent the 
circular notes by post to Paris, addressed to Rimbeaux, for the 
plaintiffs' use abroad. The notes were lost, and the plaintiffs 
brought this action to recover their value. 

Held, that as there was a possibility of Ike notes being 
made available, and of the bank becoming liable to pay any 
of the indicated correspondents who might cash them, there 
was no obligation on the bank to refund to the 'plaintiffs the 
money they had paid without a sufficient indemnity. 



Consignee of Goods may defeat right of Consignor to stoppage in 
transitu by a bona fide assignment of the Bills of Lading for 
value. 

LICKBAREOW v. MASON. [1788] 
(2 Ter. Eep. 63 ; 1 H. B. 357 ; 6 East, 21 ; IE. E. 425.) 

Turing having received an order from Freeman, shipped a 
quantity of corn on board the Endeavour to Liverpool. Two 
bills of lading were sent to Freeman. Before the Endeavour 
set sail Turing heard that Freeman had become bankrupt. 
Turing at once endorsed the bill of lading remaining in his 
custody to the defendants, and transmitted it to them with an 
invoice of the goods authorizing them to obtain possession of 
the goods for the benefit of Turing. On the arrival of the 
Endeavour at Liverpool, the defendants presented the bill of 



THE ASSIGNMENT OE CONTRACT. 103 

lading and the goods were duly delivered to them. Freeman, 
however, before he became bankrupt, negotiated the two bills 
for valuable consideration to Messrs. Lickbarrow. The plaintiffs 
sued the defendants in trover. 

Held, that the plaintiffs tvere entitled to judgment, for a 
bona fide assignment of a bill of lading by endorsement to 
a holder for value defeats the right of the vendor to stoppage 
in transitu. 



A Personal Action cannot be brought after the Death of one of the 
parties to it, unless special damage has been caused. 

FINLAY v. CHIENEY. [1887] 

(57 L. J. Q. B. 247 ; 20 Q. B. D. 494 ; 58 L. T. 664 ; 36 W. R. 534 ; 
52 J. P. 324— C. A.) 

The plaintiff, who had been a housekeeper in the service of a 
deceased person, brought this action against the executors of the 
deceased to recover damages for breach of promise of marriage 
by the deceased, who had refused to carry out his promise to 
marry her. 

Held, that this being a personal action, no action would 
lie, for actio personalis moritur cum persona, except in 
respect of special damage — that is, actual loss to the temporal 
estate of the promisee, flowing directly from the breach, or 
ivhich may reasonably be supposed to have been in the con- 
templation of both parties at the time of the promise as the 
probable result of the breach of it. 

Vide Hatchard v. Mege, infra. The same principle applies in 

torts. 



1(14 CONTRACT. 

DISCHARGE OF CONTRACT. 



A Licence, although by deed or for value, is revocable at will. 

WOOD v. LEADBITTER. [1855] 
(14 L. J. Ex. 161 ; 13 M. &amp; W. 838 ; 9 Jur. 187.) 

In the year 1843, when Lord Eglinton was steward of the Don- 
caster races, tickets were sold in Doncaster at one guinea each, 
which were understood to entitle the holders to admission into 
the grand stand and its enclosure, and to remain there during 
the races. They were issued with Lord Eglinton's privity, 
but they were not sealed or signed by him. The plaintiff, 
having purchased one of these tickets, went into the enclosure 
while the races were going on, and while there and during the 
races the defendant, by the order of Lord Eglinton, desired him 
to depart, and gave him notice that if he did not go away force 
would be used to turn him out. The plaintiff, having in no way 
misconducted himself, refused to go, and thereupon the defen- 
dant, by order of Lord Eglinton, forced him out, using no 
unnecessary violence. An action for assault was brought by the 
plaintiff against the defendant. 

Held, a licence, if a mere licence, although under seal, is 
revocable at pleasure, and that it was therefore lawful for 
Lord Eglinton, without returning the guinea or assigning 
any reason for what ha did, to order any holder of a ticket 
to quit the stand and enclosure, and after reasonable time to 
force him to leave, though such holder had not misconducted 
himself, and but fur I he order to quit ivould have been justi- 
fied bg the purchase of the ticket in remaining there. 

Note. — It has been held that a licence to cut trees and remove the 
timber is irrevocable in law, as it was a licence coupled with a legal 
interest conferred on the buyer, and the absence of a deed made no 
difference since the Judicature Act. Jones v. Tankerville, 127 
L. T. 267. 



DISCHARGE OF CONTRACT. 105 



Generally, any variance without consent of Surety in the terms of 
Contract between Principal Debtor and Creditor, discharges 
the Surety. 

PYBUS v. GIBB AND OTHERS. [1857] 
(26 L. J. Q. B. 41 ; 6 El. &amp; Bl. 902 ; 3 Jur. (N. S.) 315 ; 5 W. E. 44. 

The condition of a bond recited that Gibb had been appointed 
bailiff of a County Court under 9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. 95, and stipulated 
for the proper execution by Gibb of all warrants, &amp;c. issued out 
of the said Court to the high bailiff, and making true returns 
thereof according to the rules regulating the practice of the said 
Court, and for his due performance of the office of bailiff, and 
for his not taking any fees except those specified in that Act. 
After this bond, and before any breach occurred, statutes were 
passed increasing the jurisdiction of the County Court in point 
of amount, giving it jurisdiction on matters of insolvency and 
over absconding debtors, and enabling any one of the bailiff's 
authorized by the judge to sell goods seized in execution with- 
out the intervention of a sworn broker. A breach having been 
committed by Gibb, the plaintiff brought this action against 
Gibb and his sureties. 

Held, that by these statutes the duties and liabilities of 
the office were essential/// changed, and the risk of the 
sureties increased ; and that consequently they were dis- 
charged, notwithstanding that the breach of duty relied upon 
arose entirely out of the original duties of the office. 



I in; contract. 

To constitute a Legal Tender the whole amount due must be 
tendered, an. I if the Creditor will not accept it, the Debtor 
must continue always ready and willing to pay the Debt, 
and must pay the Money into Court. 

DIXON v. CLAKKE. [1848] 
16 L. J. C. P. 237 ; 5 C. B. 365 ; 5 D. &amp; L. 155.) 

The sum of 13/. 15s. being due by the defendant, the plaintiff 
refused an offer to pay 51. which had been made by the 
defendant. 8/. 10s. was subsequently paid by the defendant, 
leaving due the 5/. which the defendant had previously offered 
to pay. On an action being brought the defendant contended 
that, having tendered the 51., he was entitled to the costs of the 
action. 

Held, that the offer to pay 51. was not a good tender, as 
it ivas part only of the money then due, and that the defen- 
&lt; In nt, in order to prove a good tender, should have shown that 
he had been alivays ready to perform, entirely the contract, 
and thai he did perform it as far as he was able, by 
tendering the requisite money, the plaintiff himself pre- 
cluding a complete performance by refusing to receive it, 
and Ibis must be accompanied by a payment into Court in 
order to entitle the defendant to his costs. 



DISCHARGE OF CONTRACT BY ACT OF GOD. 



A Person cannot escape liability by alleging an act of God unless 
something has happened which he cannot reasonably foresee 
and provide against. 

NUGENT v. .SMITH. [1876] 
(45 L. J. C. P. 697 ; 1 C. P. D. 423 ; 34 L. T. 827 ; 25 \V. E. 

117— C. A.) 
The plaintiff shipped a mare of his by the defendant's ship. 
A storm was encountered, and owing partly to the badness of the 



DISCHARGE OF CONTRACT BY ACT OF GOD. L07 

weather and partly to the conduct of the mare herself, the mare 
received a fatal injury. 

Held, a loss is a loss by the act of God if it is occasioned 
by the elementary forces of nature unconnected with the 
agency of man or other cause ; and a common carrier is 
entitled to immunity in respect of loss so occasioned if he 
can show that it could not have been prevented by any 
amount of foresight, pains and care reasonably to be required 
of him. 

If the loss is occasioned partly by the act of God as 
above defined, and partly by some other cause, which if it 
had been the sole cause of the loss woidd have furnished a 
defence, the carrier will be entitled to immunity in respect 
of such loss if he can shoio that it could not have been pre- 
vented by any amount of foresight, pains and care reason- 
ably to be required of him. 

In this case the carrier satisfied these requirements, and 
judgment was accordingly given for the defendants. 



In the absence of Negligence a Carrier is not liable for Damage 
caused by the act of God, the King's Enemies, or by inherent 
defect in goods carried. 

BLOWER v. G. W. R. CO. [1872] 
(41 L. J. C. P. 268 ; L. R. 7 C. P. 655 ; 26 L. T. 883 ; 20 W. R. 776.) 

The plaintiff sent his bullock by the defendant company's 
line from Monmouth to Northampton. The bullock was safely 
placed in a truck at Monmouth, but proved obstreperous, and 
by dint of great effort succeeded in escaping from the truck. It 
was found that the company had been guilty of no negligence, 



108 CONTRA.CT. 

and that the truck was perfectly fit to receive and retain an 
ordinary bullock. 

Held, the company were not liable for the loss of the 
animal; that the liability of a railway company as common 
carriers of live animals as well as yoods is, in the absence 
of any negligence, subject not only to the exemption of the 
act of God or the Quecrfs enemies, but to the further exemp- 
tion of any act wholly attributable to the development of a 
latent inherent vice in the animal itself. 



DISCHARGE OF CONTRACT BY LAPSE 
OF TIME. 



Ignorance of Cause of Action is no answer to the Statute of Limi- 
tations, but Concealed Fraud and the absence of reasonable 
means of discovery of such fraud is. 

GIBBS v. GUILD. [1882 J 

(51 L. J. &lt;i. B. 313 ; 9 Q. B. I). 59; 46 L. T. 248 ; 30 VV*. R. 
591— C. A.) 

The plaintiff brought this action against the defendant as 
promoter of a company to recover damages for fraudulent mis- 
representations made by him more than six years before action 
brought by reason of which the plaintiff was induced to buy 
shares in a certain company. The statement of defence alleged 
that the cause of action did not arise within six years, to which 
the plaintiff replied that he did not discover the fraud, or that 
the defendant had been a party to it, and that the plaintiff could 
not by reasonable diligence have discovered it, until within six 
years before the action. Further, that the defendant actively 
and deliberately concealed the existence and means of discover- 
ing such fraud, in order to prevent and delay the plaintiff from 
discovering it within six years. 

Held, on demurrer, that this was a good reply. 



DISCHARGE OF CONTRACT BY BREACH. 109 

DISCHARGE OF CONTRACT BY BREACH. 

Where a Contract for the execution of an entire Work is not 
completed by one Party, A., through no fault of the other 
Party, B., A. can recover nothing although the non-completion 
is due to no fault of A. 

CUTTER v. POWELL. [1795] 
(6 T. R, 320; 3 R. R. 185.) 

The defendant employed T. Cutter as second mate to the ship 
Governor Parry on her voj 7 age to England. The terms were 
contained in a note handed by the defendant to the deceased, 
which ran as follows : — 

" Ten days after the ship Governor Parry, myself master, 
arrives at Liverpool, I promise to pay to Mr. T. Cutter the sum 
of thirty guineas, provided he proceeds, continues, and does his 
duty as second mate in the said ship from hence to the port of 
Liverpool. — KiDgston, July 31st, 1793." 

Before the ship arrived at Liverpool the mate died, and as he 
had performed his duties till the day of his death, his adminis- 
tratrix brought this action to recover what was due. 

Held, that no wages could be recovered either on the 
contract or on a quantum meruit. 

" This is a written contract and speaks for itself. And 
as it is entire, and as the defendant's promise depends on a 
condition precedent to be performed by the other party, the 
condition must be performed before the other party is entitled 
to receive anything under it. It has been argued, however, 
that the plaintiff may now recover on a quantum meruit . 
but she has no right to desert the agreement ; for tvhenever 
there is an express contract the parties must be guided by 
it ; and one party cannot relinquish or abide by it as it 
may suit his advantage. Here the intestate was, by the 



1J0 CONTRACT. 

terms of his contract, to perform a given duty before he could 
call upon the defendant I" pay him anything; if was a 
condition precedent, trillion I performing which the defendant 
is not liable. And that seems to me to conclude the question ; 
the intestate did not perform the contract on his port; he 
was not indeed to blame for not doing it ; but still, as this 
luas a condition precedent, and as he did not perform it, his 
representative is not entitled to recover." 



Where a Contract for the execution of an entire Work is not com- 
pleted by one Party, A., through no default of the other, A. 
can recover nothing. 

SUMPTER v. HEDGES. [1898] 

(67 L. J. Q. B. 545 ; (1898) 1 Q. B. 673; 78 L. T. 378 ; 

46 W. R. 454— C. A.) 

The plaintiff, a builder, in consideration of a lump sum to be 
paid to him by the defendant, agreed to erect certain buildings 
upon the defendant's land. Before the completion of the 
buildings the plaintiff abandoned the contract, and thereupon 
the defendant took possession of the buildings which had been 
erected and completed them himself. In an action by the 
plaintiff, in respect of so much of the agreed work as had been 
executed before the abandonment of the contract, to recover as 
for the value of work done and materials provided — 

Held, that in the absence of evidence of a fresh agree- 
ment by the defendant to pay the plaintiff the value of the 
work done and materials provided prior to the abandonment 
of the original contract, the plaintiff was not entitled to 
recover ; and that the mere fact of the defendant talcing 
possession of the buildings ivas not evidence from which a 
fresh agreement could be inferred. 



DISCHARGE OF CONTRACT BY BREACH. Ill 

Where a Contract is not Entire but Divisible, incomplete per- 
formance by one Party does not disentitle him to payment on 
a quantum meruit for the work actually performed, but 
entitles the other Party to such Damages as are caused by 
his default. 

RITCHIE v. ATKINSON. [1808] 
(10 Kast, 295; 10 R. R. 307.) 

The plaintiff, who was the master of the ship Adelphi, a 
vessel of 400 tons, made an agreement with the defendant that 
the ship should proceed to St. Petersburg, and that the 
defendant should there load her with a complete cargo, and that 
the ship should then proceed to London, and that the plaintiff 
should receive 51. per ton for hemp and 5s. a ton for iron as 
freight. The British consul informed the plaintiff that an 
embargo would be placed on British ships in the harbour at 
St. Petersburg. Thereupon the master put to sea with the 
vessel only half full of the defendant's cargo. In an action by 
the plaintiff on a quantum meruit — 

Held, that the contract was not entire but divisible^ and 
that the delivery of a complete cargo was not a condition 
precedent, but that the plaintiff might recover freight for the 
amount of cargo actually shipped at the stipulated rale per 
ton, and that the defend ant had his remedy in damages for 
short delivery. 



A Breach of a Condition is a Ground for Rescission or Damages. 

BEEN v. BURNESS. [1862] 

(32 L. J. Q. B. 204 ; 3 B. &amp; 8. 751 ; 9 Jur. (N. S.) 620 ; 8 L. T. 207 ; 

11W.E. 496.) 

By a memorandum of charter-party dated London, the 19th 
of October, the plaintiff's ship was chartered to the defendant as 
follows : "It is this day mutually agreed between A. Behn, the 



112 CONTRACT. 

owner of the good ship or vessel called the Marfaban, of 420 
tons or thereabouts, now in the port of Amsterdam, and James 
Burness, of London, merchant, that the said ship, being tight, 
staunch, strong and every way fitted and ready for the voyage, 
shall, with all possible dispatch, proceed direct to Newport, 
Monmouthshire," &amp;c. On the loth October the ship was at 
Nieuwediep, and under favourable circumstances would have 
reached the docks at Amsterdam in twelve hours more, but in 
consequence of wind and the absence of steam-tug power, she 
did not reach the docks till the 23rd of October. She dis- 
charged her cargo with all possible dispatch, was immediately 
made ready for sea, and without any delay sailed on the 16th 
of November, and proceeded direct to Newport, where she 
arrived on the 1st of December. The defendant refused to load 
the ship, as he had engaged to do by the charter-party. In an 
action brought against him for such refusal, it was — 

Held, that the words " now in the port of Amsterdam " 
in the charter-party amounted to a condition, and that, as 
the ship tvas not in the port of Amsterdam at the time 
when the charter-party was made, the defendant was justified 
in saying that there had been a failure of performance of a 
condition precedent, and in refusing altogether to carry out 
the contract. 



Where a Party to a Contract renounces it he can be sued at once 
although the Date of Performance has not arrived. 

HOCHSTER v. DE LA TOUR. [1853] 

(22 L J. Q. B. 455 ; 2 El. &amp; Bl 678 ; 17 Jur. 972 ; 1 W. R, 469.) 

The plaintiff agreed with the defendant to enter his employ 
as a courier, and to travel with him for three months certain, 
from the 1st of June following, for a certain monthly wage. 
The defendant, however, thought better of the matter, and 
before the 1st of June told the plaintiff he would not require 



DISCHARGE OF CONTRACT BY BREACH. 113 

his services. The plaintiff promptly issued a writ, and claimed 
damages for breach of contract. Ihe defendant in the action 
contended that no action could be brought till the date of 
performance. 

Held, after the refusal by the defendant to employ, the 
plaintiff was entitled to bring an action immediately, and 
was not bound to wait until after the day agreed upon for 
the commencement of performance. 



A Person with whom a Contract has been Broken may fulfil the 
same himself, but must not do it Unreasonably, Oppressively 
or Extravagantly. 

LE BLANCHE v. LONDON &amp; NOETH WESTERN 
RAILWAY CO. [1876] 

(45 L. J. C. P. 521 ; 1 C. P. D. 286 ; 34 L. T. 667 ; 24 W. R. 808.) 

The plaintiff, being desirous of going from Liverpool to 
Scarborough, took a through ticket of the 'defendant company. 
To get to Scarborough it was necessary to change at Leeds and 
York on to the lines of two other companies. The defendants' 
train having arrived late at Leeds, the plaintiff missed his con- 
nection both there and at York, and instead of arriving at 
Scarborough at 7.30, as he would have done if he had been able 
to make his connections, he found himself at York at 7 o'clock, 
and no train till 8 o'clock. He promptly ordered a special, 
which took him to Scarborough by 8.30, about an hour and 
a half before the time he would have arrived if he had caught 
the 8 o'clock train. He then brought an action to recover 12/., 
the cost of the special train, from the railway company. 

Held, although the defendants had been guilty of a breach 
of contract, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover the cost 
of ihe special, for though a person with whom a contract 

j. i 



114 CONTRACT. 

has been broken has a right to fulfil that contract for him- 
self as nearly as man be, he must not do this unreasonably 
or oppressively as regards the other party, or extravagantly ', 
and therefore tl&lt;e plaintiff was not justified in taking a 
special to save himself the discomfort and ennui of an hour's 
detention at York. 



CONDITIONS AND WARRANTIES. 



There is an Implied Condition on the Letting of a Furnished House 
that it is fit for Habitation. 

SMITH v. MASKABLE. [1843] 
(12 L. J. Ex. 223 ; 1 1 M. &amp; W. 5 ; Car. &amp; M. 479.) 

The defendant entered upon the occupation of a furnished house 
under an agreement to pay a weekly rental of eight guineas for 
five weeks, and at the expiration of one week left the house on 
account of its being infested with bugs. 

Held, in an action for use and occupation to recover 
the balance of five weeks 1 rental, that the nuisance, was a 
defence to the action, for a man who lets a ready-furnishi d 
house does so on an implied condition or obligation that it 

is in a fit state far occupation. 



A Warranty must be made during the Negotiations for Sale. 

HOPKINS r. TANQUERAY. [1854] 
(23 L. J. C. P. 162; 15 C. B. 130; 2 0. L. K, 842 ; 18 Jur. 608.) 

The defendant, whose horse was at an auction stable for sale, 
seeing the plaintiff on the day before the sale examining the 



CONDITIONS AND WARRANTIES. 115 

horse, told him bond fide that the horse was " sound in every 
respect." Next day the horse was put up for sale by auction 
without a warranty, and the plaintiff, induced by what the 
defendant had told him, became the purchaser. 

Held, in an action for a breach of warranty, that there 
was no evidence to go to the jury that the horse was sold 
with a warranty ; the representation by the defendant not 
Jorming part of the contract of sale, not having been made 
during any negotiations for the sale. 

What passed in the stable undoubtedly amounted to a 
representation that the horse was sound ; and if it had 
been made pending a contract between the parties for the 
sale of the horse it would have amounted to a warranty. 



Railway Companies are not Insurers of Passengers, but must take 
" due care," and are liable for Negligence. 

KEADHEAD v. MIDLAND EAILWAY CO. [1869] 
(38 L. J.Q. B. 169; L.E. 4 Q. B. 379; 16 L. T. 485 ; 9 B. &amp; S. 519 ; 

17 W. E. 737.) 

The plaintiff was being carried as a passenger for hire on 
the defendant railway, when the carriage in which he was 
travelling left the metals and was upset. The accident was 
caused by the breaking of the tyre of one of the wheels of the 
carriage, owing to a latent defect in the tyre, which was not 
attributable to any fault on the part of the manufacturer, and 
could not be detected previously to the breaking. 

Held, that the company were not liable in respect of 
such injury , there being no contract of warranty and in- 
surance in the case of passengers that the carriage should 
be in all respects perfect for its purpose, that is to say, 
free from all defects likely to cause peril. 

i2 



116 CONTRACT. 

There is no contract, either of general or limited war- 
ranty and insurance, entered into by the carrier of pas- 
sengers : the contract of such a carrier and the obligation 
undertaken by him is to take due care {including in that 
term the use of skill and foresight) to carry the passengers 
safe! j). The absence of such care — in other ivords, negli- 
gence — would alone be a breach of this contract and render 
the carrier liable to damages. 



Railway Companies are Insurers of Personal Baggage, whether to 
be carried in Guard's Van or with the Passenger, provided 
the Passenger is not guilty of Contributory Negligence. 

THE GREAT WESTERN RAILWAY COMPANY v. BUNCH. 

[1888] 

(57 L. J. Q. B. 361 ; 13 A. C. 31 ; 17 Q. B. D. 215 ; 58 L. T. 128 ; 

36 W. R. 785.) 

Mrs. Bunch, being about to travel with her husband by a 
Great Western Railway train, arrived at the station on Christ- 
mas Eve forty minutes before the train, which was not yet 
drawn up at the platform, was timed to arrive. A porter 
received the luggage and labelled two pieces. Mrs. Bunch told 
the porter that she wished the third piece, a bag, to be put into 
the carriage with her, and asked him if it would be safe to 
leave it with him. He replied that it would be quite safe, and 
that he would guard the luggage and put it into the train. She 
then went to meet her husband at the ticket office, where he took 
the ticket. The plaintiffs returned together in ten minutes, and 
found that the labelled articles were in the van but that the bag 
was missing. 

Held, the luggage lairing been handed t&lt;&gt; the porter 
a reasonable time before the departure &lt;f tin' train, the 
company was liable. 



CONDITIONS AND WARRANTIES. 117 

A railway company, in accepting a passenger s luggage 
for carriage in a passenger train, and in the carriage 
with the passenger himself, enters into a contract as 
common carrier, modified only to the extent that if loss 
happens by reason of want of care of the passenger him- 
self who has taken within his own immediate control the 
goods which are lost, their contract as insurers does not 
apply to loss occasioned by the passenger s own default. 



A Railway Company is not liable where Luggage is handed to a 
Porter for Safe Custody and not for Transit. 

WELCH v. LONDON AND NOETH WESTEEN EAILWAY 
COMPANY. [1886] 

(34 W. E. 166.) 

The plaintiff, on the 10th of November, 1884, went to the 
defendants' station at Liverpool, and finding that the train by 
which he had intended to travel had gone, he said to the 
porter to whom he had entrusted his luggage : "I missed the 
train. I find it has gone. Now, John, look after the luggage 
until the next train goes to Euston." He theu went to the 
billiard room of the hotel, and an hour later returned to find 
that his luggage had disappeared. He therefore brought this 
action to recover damages for its loss. 

Held, by the Divisional Court, the defendants were not 
liable, and that this case icas clearly distinguishable from 
Great Western Railway Co. v. Bunch, for in this ease 
the luggage was not delivered to the porter on behalf of 
the company for transit, but was delivered to him to be 
looked after by him on his own responsibility. 



118 CONTRACT. 

A. L. Smith, J. : " It makes all the difference for l lie 
purpose j or which the chattels are handed to the porter. 
If I give my luggage to a porter while 1 go to &lt;jet my 
ticket, I should say lie takes it for the purpose of transit, 
but if I deliver it to him while 1 go to play at billiards, 
then it is otherwise." 



Goods Sold by Description which the Buyer has no Opportunity of 
Inspecting are subject to an Implied Warranty that they are 
Merchantable under the Description Sold, and the maxim 
" caveat emptor " does not apply. 

JONES v. JUST. [1868] 
(37 L. J. Q. B. 89 ; L. E. 3 Q. B. 197 ; 18 L. T. 208 ; 16 W. R. 643.) 

The plaintiffs, merchants at Liverpool, through their brokers, 
contracted to buy from the defendant, a merchant in London, 
certain bales of Manilla hemp, which were expected to arrive 
per ship from Singapoie. On ariival the bales were examined, 
and a number of them were found to be in such a state as to 
afford strong evidence that they had at some time, probably 
from a shipwreck when on the voyage from Manilla to Singa- 
pore, been wetted through with salt water, and had afterwards 
been unpacked, dried and repacked in the bales which were 
afterwards shipped at Singapore. An action was brought by 
the plaintiffs to recover the loss in value on account of this 
damage. 

Held, that in every contract to supply goods of a 
specif ed description which tin buyer has no opportunity 
to inspect, the goods must not only in fad answer the 
specific description, but must also be saleable or mer- 
chantable under that description; so that in thus case thi 



CONDITIONS AND WARRANTIES. I 19 

question for the jury was, whether this hemp delivend at 
Singapore was merchantable or saleable in the market 
under the description of " Manilla hemp" and the jury 
having found that it was not, the plaintiff tons entitled to 
damcnjrs. 

Held also, that the plaintiffs not having had an oppor- 
tunity of exercising any judgment of their own, the maxim 
of caveat emptor could not apply. 



Deviation of a Ship is justifiable to save Life, but not to Salve. 

SCAEAMANGA v. STAMP. [1880] 

(49 L. J. C. P. 674 ; 5 C. P. D. 295 ; 42 L. T. 840 ; 28 W. E. 691 ; 
4 Asp. M. C. 295—0. A.) 

The plaintiffs chartered the defendants' steamship Olytnpias 
to carry a cargo of wheat from Cronstadt to Gibraltar, which 
having started on her voyage, when nine days out, sighted 
another steamship, the Avion, in distress, and on nearing her 
found that the machinery of the Avion had broken down, 
and that the vessel was in a helpless condition. The weather 
was fine and the sea smooth, and there would have been no 
difficulty in taking off and so saving the crew r ; but the master 
of the Arion, being desirous of saving his ship as well as the 
lives of the crew, agreed to pay 1,000/. to the master of the 
Olympian to tow the ship into the Texel. 

Having taken the Avion in tow, the Olympias, when off the 
Dutch coast, on the way to the Texel, went ashore, and, with 
her cargo, was ultimately lost. 

The plaintiffs brought this action claiming the value of the 
goods, alleging that the goods were not lost by perils of the sea 
so as to be within the exception of the charter-party, but were 
lost through the wrongful deviation of the defendants' vessel. 



120 CONTRACT. 

Field, a deviation made by a vessel for the yyuipase of 
saving property is not justifiable, and the shipowner is 
liable to the charterer for loss or damage occasioned 
thereby. A deviation made solely for the purpose of 
saving life is justifiable. 



DA31AGES FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT. 



Damages for Breach of Contract represent the Actual Loss 
Sustained so far as it was in contemplation of the Parties at 
time of Contract. Special Circumstances affecting 1 Loss must 
be known to both Parties. 

HADLEY v. BAXENDALE. [1854] 
(23 L. J. Ex. 179 ; 9 Ex. 341 ; 2 C. L. E. 517 ; 18 Jur. 358 ; 

2 W. E. 302.) 
The plaintiff had employed a carrier to convey a broken shaft 
belonging to his mill to an engineer. The carrier was guilty 
of an unreasonable delay in delivering it, and the engineer was 
thereby prevented from at once making a new shaft from the 
model of the old one, and the mill remained idle for a con- 
siderable time. 

Held, in an action against the carrier for the delay, 
that the jury in estimating the damages were not justified 
in taking into their consideration the loss oj j/rofit.s by 
reason of the stoppage of the mill That the damages 
recoverable for a breach of contract are such as mag 
fairly and reasonably be considered as arising naturally, 
i.e., according to tin- usual course of tilings, from the 
breach of the contract itself or such as may be reasonably 
supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties 
at the time they made the contract as the probable result 
of the breach of it. 



Damages for breach of contract. 121 

Where a contract is made under special circumstances 
which are communicated by one of the contracting parties 
to the other, the damages resulting from a breich of the 
contract, which the parties would reasonably be supposed 
to have contemplated, are the amount of injury estimated 
in money which would ordinarily follow from such a 
breach of contract under the special circumstances. But 
if the special circumstances are unknown to the party 
breaking the contract, he, at the most, can only be held to 
hare contemplated the amount of injury which would 
arise generally, and in the great multitude of cases, not 
affected by any special circumstances, from such a breach 
of contract. 



A Sum of Money payable on Breach of Contract is deemed Liqui- 
dated Damages if it is a genuine Estimate of probable Loss 
caused by Breach, otherwise it will be deemed a Penalty. 

PUBLIC WOEKS COMMISSIONEE v. HILLS. [1906] 

(75 L. J. P. C. 69; (1906) A. C. 368; 94 L. T. 833; 
22 T. L. E. 589— P. C.) 

In this action, the question arose as to whether a sum of 
money, which the contract provided was to be paid in certain 
events, was to be deemed liquidated damages, in which case 
the plaintiff would be entitled to the whole amount, or was in 
the nature of a penalty, when the amount provided for in the 
contract would not be regarded, but the actual damage suffered 
would have to be estimated. 

Held, under a stipulation in a contract the criterion 
whether a sum, described either as penalty or liquidated 
damages, is truly liquidated damages, and as such not to be 
interfered with by a Court, or a penalty which covers but 



122 CONTRACT. 

does not assess the damage, lies in the ascertainment whether 
the sum stipulated for can or cannot be regarded as " a 
genuine pre-estimate of the creditor's probable or possible 
interest in the due performance of the principal obligation" 
or is a sum liable /&lt;&gt; fluctuation in amount according to 
circumstances. 

A Sum payable on the happening of one Event only is generally 
looked upon as Liquidated Damages. 

LAW v. THE LOCAL BOARD OF REDDITCH. [1892] 

(61 L. J. Q. B. 172 ; (1892) 1 Q. B. 127 ; 66 L. T. 76 ; 

56 J. P. 292— C. A.) 

A contract made with an urban authority for the construction 
of certain drainage works, provided that the works were to be 
completed in all respects and cleared of all implements, tackle, 
&amp;c. on or before the 80th April, 1889; and that in default of 
such completion the contractor should forfeit and pay to the 
urban authority the sum of K&gt;0/., and 61. for every seven days 
during which the works should be incomplete after the said 
time, and that the sums so forfeited might be recovered by the 
urban authority from the contractor as and for liquidated 
damages. 

The works remained incomplete for twelve weeks after the 
30th April, 1889, and the defendants claimed the sum of 160/., 
being 100/. and 61. per week for the twelve weeks, on the ground 
that they might be treated as liquidated damages and not as 
penalties. 

Held, that as there was only one event — the non-comple- 
tion of the work* by the specified date, upon the happening 
of which the sums of 100/. and 51. per week were to 
become payable — those sums must be considered as liquidated 
damages and not as penalties, and the plaintiff was entitled 
to judgment. 



IMPOSSIBILITY OF PERFORMANCE. 123 

Where it has been agreed by the parties to a contract 
that in case of one of them doing or omitting to do sortie 
one thing, that party shall pay a specific sum to the other 
as damages, the sum so agreed to be paid is, as a general 
rule, to be considered by the Court to be a sum in the nature 
of liquidated damages, and not in the nature of a penalty. 
There is one recognized exception to that rule, which is that 
if a large sum of money is to be payable in respect of the 
non-payment of a smaller specified sum, the Court will treat 
the larger sum as a penalty, and, not as liquidated damages. 
There is another exception to the rule, which is that if the 
sum which the one party has agreed to pay is, with regard to 
the matter in respect of which it is agreed to be paid, so large 
that if it were intended to be payable by ivay of liquidated 
damages it would amount to an absurdity, then the Court 
would hold that such could, not have been the intention of 
the parties, but would arrive at the conclusion that it was 
to be paid 1 not as liquidated damages, but as a penalty. 



DISCHARGE OF CONTRACT BY IMPOSSI- 
BILITY OF PERFORMANCE. 

Generally Impossibility of Performance is no defence to an Action 
for Breach of Contract unless caused by Act or Default of 
the other Party. 

BUDGETT v. BENNINGTON. [1891] 
(60 L. J. Q. B. 1 ; (1891) 1 Q. B. 35; 39 W. K. 131 ; 6 Asp. M. C. 

592— C. A.) 

The plaintiffs were the indorsees of a bill of lading which 
incorporated the terms of a charter-party by which seven lay- 
days were allowed for unloading the vessel, and ten days on 



124 CONTRACT. 

demurrage over and above the lay-days. By the charter-party 
the master undertook to deliver the cargo, which was a cargo of 
barley in bulk, from alongside, and, by the custom of the port 
of discharge, the unloading of such cargo was the joint act of 
the shipowner and the consignee. During the unloading, and 
before the lay-days had run out, a strike occurred amongst the 
labourers employed by the defendants, the shipowners, as well 
as amongst those employed by the plaintiffs, with the result that 
the unloading had to be discontinued for several days, and was 
not completed until after the expiration of the lay-days. In an 
action to recover back a sum paid by the plaintiffs to the 
defendants under protest in respect of a claim for demurrage — 

Held, that under the circumstances the plaintiffs were 
liable to pay demurrage, as they had not been prevented 
from discharging the vessel within the time allowed for un- 
loading by any act or default of the defendants, or those for 
whom they were responsible. 



Generally Impossibility of Performance is no defence to an Action 
for Breach of Contract, but where through no fault of either 
Party the existence of a specific thing, the continued existence 
of which is essential to the performance, is put an end to, 
the Contract is thereby Discharged. 

TAYLOR v. CALDWELL. [1863] 

(32 L. J. Q. B. 164 ; 3 B. &amp; S. 826 ; 8 L T. 356 ; 11 W. R. 726.) 

The defendants agreed to let certain gardens and music hall 
to the plaintiff on four specified days for the purpose of giving 
a series of concerts at a specified rent for each of the said 
days. The defendants were to provide a band of music and 
certain specified entertainments, and to issue advertisements of 
the entertainments. The plaintiffs were to pay 100/. in the 



IMPOSSIBILITY OF PERFORMANCE. 125 

evening of each day, to receive and take all the money paid by 
persons entering the gardens, and to provide the necessary 
artistes for the entertainments. After the agreement was 
entered into, and before the day arrived for the first concert, 
the music hall was accidentally destroyed by fire. This action 
was brought to recover damages for the injury suffered by the 
plaintiff. 

Held, although there is no doubt that where there is a 
positive contract to do a thing, not in itself unlawful, the 
contractor must perform it or pa// damages for not doing 
it, although in consequence of unforeseen accidents the per- 
formance of his contract has become unexpectedly bur- 
thensome or even impossible, yet where, from the nature of 
the contract it appears that the parties must from the 
beginning have known that it could not be fulfilled unless, 
tvhen the time arrived, some particular specified thing con- 
tinued to exist, so that when entering into the contract they 
must have contemplated such continued existence as the 
foundation of what was to be done ; there, in the absence of 
any express or implied warranty that the thing shall exist, 
the contract is not to be construed as a positive contract, 
but as subject to an implied condition that the parties shall 
be excused in case, before breach, performance becomes im- 
possible from the perishing of the thing, without default of 
the contractor. 

N.B. — This principle was followed in the Coronation cases on 
the basis that the contracts were on the implied condition that the 
procession took place, e.g., Krell v. Henry, 72 L. J. K. B. 794 ; 
(1903) 2 K. B. 740.

(38 L. J. Q.B. 98 ; L. R. 4 Q. B. 180; 19L.T. 681; 17VV.R. 491.) 

In an action of covenant by a lessee against his lessor it was 
alleged and admitted on the record that the defendant had 
covenanted that neither he nor his " assigns " should or would, 
during the term, permit to be built any messuage, &amp;c. on a 
paddock fronting the demised premises. The paddock had been 
purchased by a railway company, and conveyed to them by the 
defendant under the compulsory powers of their special Act, and 
they had erected buildings on the ground contrary to the 
covenant. It was also stated that the buildings, &amp;c. were not 
such as it was necessary for the company to erect on the land 
in question. 

Held, that as the company became assignees of the land, 
not by the voluntary act of the former owner, but by compul- 
sion o/ law, the defendant was not liable. The plaintiff 
was, therefore, one of a class of persons injured by the con- 
struction of the railway, for whom the legislature had 
provided no compensation. 

u There can be no doubt that a man may, by an absolute 
contract, bind himself to perform things which subsequently 
become impossible or to pay damages for their non-per- 
formance, and this construction is to be put upon an 
unqualified undertaking ivhere the event which causes the 
impossibility was, or might have been, anticipated and 
guarded against in the contract, or where the impossibility 
arises from the act or deft nit of the promissor. But where 
the event is of such a character that it cannot reasonably 



IMPOSSIBILITY OF PERFORMANCE. 127 

be supposed to have been in the contemplation of the con- 
tracting parties when the contract was made, they will not 
be held bound by general words which, though large enough to 
include, were not used with reference to the possibility of the 
particular contingency which afterwards happens. It is on 
this principle that the act of God is, in some cases, said, 
to excuse the breach of a contract It is on this prin- 
ciple that it has been held that an impossibility arising from 
an act of the legislature subsequent to the contract discharges 
the contractor from liability" 



Contract depending on Personal Skill is Discharged by Illness 
or Death of Contractor. 

EOBINSON v. DAVISON. [1871] 
(40 L. J. Ex. 172 ; L. E. 6 Ex. 269 ; 24 L.T. 755 ; 19 W. E. 1036.) 

The defendant agreed with the plaintiff that his wife, a 
pianist of great renown, should perform for the plaintiff at a 
certain concert. The day before the concert was to take place 
the lady in question was taken so ill that it would have endan- 
gered her life to attempt to play. An action was brought by 
the plaintiff for breach of this agreement. 

Held, tv here a contract is one dependent on the personal 
skill of the person performing , and the performance is pre- 
vented by the act of God, such as death or illness of the 
person to perform it, no action will lie for the non-perform- 
ance of the contract, for though no condition be expressed 
in words, such a contract is based on the assumption of 
sufficient liealth, and is subject to an implied condition that 
if the part// to perform l&gt;e, without his own default, dis- 
abled by illness, he shall be excused. 



128 CONTRACT. 

Of course, the parties might expressly contract that in- 
capacity should not excuse, and thus /&gt;reclude the condition 
of health from being annexed to their agreement. Here 
they have not done so ; and as they have been silent on that 
point, the contract must be taken to have been conditional 
and not absolute. 



DISCHARGE OF CONTRACT BY OPERATION 

OF LA W. 



A Material Alteration of a Written Instrument avoids it. 

SUFFEL v. BANK OF ENGLAND. [1882] 

(51 L. J. Q. B. 401 ; 9 Q. B. D. 555 ; 47 L. T. 146 ; 30 W. E. 932 ; 

46 J. P. 500— C. A.) 

Certain notes had been obtained from Payne, Smith &amp; Co., 
bankers in London, by a forged cheque ; these notes were 
changed at the Bank of England for the notes sued upon in 
this action, which notes were bought by the plaintiff, a banker 
at Brussels, in the ordinary way of his trade. The numbers of 
the notes had been erased and others substituted. Payment 
of these notes had been stopped at the bank, and a notice 
specifying their original number had been issued. An action 
was brought by the plaintiffs as bond fide holders for value of the 
notes, which were of the value of 500/., claiming payment 
thereof. 

Held, that a material alteration of a written instrument 
avoids it, and that in this case the alteration by erasure of 
the number and the substitution of another is a material 
alteration which avoids the instrument, so that a bona fide 
holder for value could not maintain an action upon such 
notes. 



DISCHARGE BY OPERATION OF LAW. 129 

Discharge of a Bankrupt acts as a Release of all Debts even 
though he subsequently promises to pay the Debts. 

HEATHER v. WEBB. [1876] 
(46 L. J. C. P. 89 ; 2 C. P. D. 1 ; 25 W. R. 253.) 

The plaintiff had acted as solicitor for the defendant, and 
there was due to him the sum of 15/. The following year the 
defendant liquidated his affairs by arrangement under the Bank- 
ruptcy Act, 1869, and a discharge was granted him. In spite 
of this discharge the defendant promised to pay the amount 
due, but changing his mind refused to pay, and this action was 
accordingly brought. 

Held, that a subsequent promise to pay a debt released 
h) a discharge in bankruptcy is made for no consideration, 
and no action can be brought upon it. 



AGENCY. 



The Husband is only liable for Debts contracted by his Wife as 
his Agent. Secret Revocation of Authority to Wife to act 
as his Agent renders Husband not liable to new Creditors, 
although the Goods supplied are Necessaries, provided he 
makes her a reasonable Allowance. 

DEBENHAM v. MELLON. [1880] 

(50 L. J. Q. B. 155 ; 6 App. Gas. 24 ; 43 L. T. 673 ; 29 W. R. 141 ; 
45 J. P. 252— H L.) 

Mrs. Mfdlon, the wife of the defendant, was living with her 
husband at Bradford, where both were employed in managing a 
hotel. The plaintiff supplied her with clothing for the use of 
herself and the defendant's children to the value of 42/. The 
goods were admitted to be necessaries in the sense that they 

J. K 



] 30 CONTRACT. 

were suitable to the position in life of the defendant. Before 
the wife began to deal with the plaintiff, tin- defendant had 
agreed with her that he would make her an allowance, and that 
she should not order goods upon credit, but no notice of that 
agreement had been given to anyone. 

Held, that where a husband and wife are living together, 
the question of whether a husband is liable for the debts of 
his wife is a question of whether she has the express or 
ini plied, authority to pledge the credit of her husband as his 
agent, and such a question is one of fact, and where such 
authority has been once given in the case of certain trades- 
men, such authority could only be revoked by express notice 
to those tradesmen of the revocation. An authority to 
pledge the credit if the husband to purchase necessaries 
may be implied where the two are living together, but such 
an implied authority is negatived where, as in this case, a 
reasonable alloivance is made by the husband to the wife 
sufficient to cover a proper expenditure for her own and the 
children'' s clothing. And where, asm this case, the husband, 
having given the wife a reasonable alloivance, has forbidden 
the wife to buy goods on credit, without giving notice to 
anyone of the fact, and he is ignorant of what his wife is 
doing, he is not liable for the price of goods supplied to her 
order by a tradesman with whom she had not previously 
dealt before being forbidden to buy on credit, although the 
goods consist of clothes for the wife and children suitable to 
their position in life. 



AGENCY. 131 

Where Husband and Wife are separated through fault of Husband, 
the Wife has an implied Authority to pledge Husband's 
Credit, but where Separation is the fault of the Wife, there 
is no such implied Authority. 

WILSON v. GLOSSOP. [1888] 

(57 L. J. Q. B. 161 ; 20 Q. B. D. 354 ; 58 L. T. 707 ; 36 W. E. 296 ; 
52 J. P. 246— C. A.) 

The defendant filed a petition for divorce on the ground of 
his wife's adultery. At the trial it was found that the wife had 
committed adultery with the connivance of her husband. After 
the defendant had charged his wife with adultery, he turned 
her out of doors without any means of support, and she went to 
her mother, who supplied her with necessaries. The mother 
then brought this action to recover 40/. for the maintenance of 
the wife for forty weeks. 

Held, the plaintiff ivas entitled to recover. A wife who 
leaves her husband without cause and without consent, 
carries no implied authority with her to maintain herself at 
his expense. But if the husband ivrongfully compels his 
wife to leave his home, as in this case, he is bound to main- 
lain her elseivhere, and she has therefore implied authority 
to pledge his credit elseivhere. 



Where a Principal fraudulently keeps back the knowledge of a 
defect in an Article from his Agent so that the Agent makes 
an innocent Misrepresentation, the Principal is liable. 

LUDGATEE v. LOYE. [1881] 
(44 L. T. 694 ; 45 J. P. 600— C. A.) 

The defendant's son, acting for the defendant, and with the 
defendant's authority, represented that certain sheep which he 

k2 



132 CONTRACT. 

sold to the plaintiff were all right. The defendant had fraudu- 
lently concealed from his son that the sheep had the rot, and 
fraudulently gave the son authority to sell them for the best 
price, intending that the son should represent that they were 
sound. 

Held, that the defendant was liable in an action to 
recover damages for fraudulent misrepresentation. Where 
a principal employs an agent ignorant of the truth, in order 
that such agent may innocently make a false statement 
believing it to be true, and may so deceive the party with 
whom he is dealing, the representation by the agent becomes 
a misrepresentation by the principal so as to vitiate the 
contract. 

Note. — In the absence of fraud a principal is not liable for the 
unauthorized statement of his agent : Cornfoot v. Fowke, 9 L. J. Ex. 
297. 



A Principal is liable for acts done within the apparent Authority 

of his Agent. 

PICKEEING v. BUSK. [1812] 
(15 East, 38; 13 R. E. 364.) 

Swallow, a broker, had purchased hemp on behalf of the 
plaintiff which had been placed in Swallow's name at the request 
of the plaintiff. Swallow subsequently contracted to sell hemp 
to Hay ward &amp; Co., and having none of his own to deliver, trans- 
ferred the hemp of the plaintiff into the name of Hay ward &amp; Co. 
for which they paid him the value. Hayward &amp; Co. shortly 
afterwards became bankrupt, and the plaiutiff discovering these 
circumstances demanded the hemp from the defendants, their 
assignees, and upon their refusal to deliver up the hemp, the 
present action was brought. 

Held, that a broker may bind his principal within flic 
limits of the authority with which he has been apparently 



AGENCY. 133 

clothed by the principal in respect of the subject-matter. 
Strangers can only look to the acts of the parties and to the 
external indicia of property ', and not to the private com- 
munications which may pass between a principal and his 
broker ; and if a person authorise another to assume the 
apparent right of disposing of properly in the ordinary 
course of trade., it must be presumed that the apparent 
authority is the real authority. 



The Master of a Ship is the Agent of the Owner to pledge his 
Credit only in the case of Necessity, and the Owner is only 
liable for Actual Necessaries. 

THE "PONTIDA." [1884] 
(53 L. J. P. 78 ; 9 P. D. 177 ; 51 L. T. 849 ; 33 W. E. 38 ; 5 Asp. 

M. C. 330.) 

The plaintiffs had advanced money on a bottomry bond to 
pay off claims for repairs on the " Pontida." The defendants 
refused to pay the full amount of the bottomry bond on the 
ground that the master of the " Pontida " had exceeded his 
authority, and that the repairs which had been carried out were 
more than were necessary. 

Held, the master of a ship is the agent of the owner to 
pledge his credit only in the case of necessity, and to the 
extent of that which is necessary to enable the ship to com- 
plete her voyage, and he cannot by giving a bottomry bond 
for an excessive amount fix the owner with liability for any- 
thing beyond that which is necessary. 



134 CONTRACT. 

A Person making a Contract on behalf of a non-existent Principal, 
is personally liable on it. Such a Contract entered into on 
behalf of a Company before Incorporation, cannot be ratified 
by it on its subsequent Incorporation. 

KELNER v. BAXTER. [1866] 

(36 L. J. C. P. 94; L. R. 2 C. P. 174 ; 12 Jur. (N. S.) 1016; 
15 L. T. 213; 15 W. R. 278.) 

The plaintiff and the defendants were desirous of starting a 
company, to take the plaintiff's premises and stock-in-trade. 
The plaintiff sent a written proposal to sell the premises, &amp;c., 
which was directed to and accepted by the defendants "on behalf 
of the proposed G. R. A. H. Co. (Limited)." The company 
was not then in existence. The plaintiff brought his action on 
this agreement. 

Held, the defendants were liable, for if there be no 
existent principal, a contract binds the persons professing 
to contract as agents. The company being non-existent at 
the time of the agreement no ratification was possible, and 
the defendants were personally liable, and parol evidence 
was not admissible to show a contrary intention. 



If an Agent makes a secret Profit he must account for same to 
his Principal. 

MORISON v. THOMPSON. [1874] 

(43 L. J. Q. B. 215 ; L. R. 9 Q. B. 480 ; 30 L. T. 869 ; 

22 W. R. 859.) 

The dpfendant having been authorized by the plaintiff to 
purchase on his behalf a particular ship as cheaply as she could 
be got, made an arrangement, without the plaintiff's knowledge, 
with the vendors' broker, who had a right to retain the excess of 
the purchase-money, over 8,5007., by which the defendant pur- 



AGENCY. 135 

chased the ship for 9,250/., and retained for his own use 225/., 
part of the excess. 

Held, that the plaintiff was entitled to the amount so 
retained by the defendant, inasmuch as it was a 'profit 
acquired by an agent in connection with his agency without 
the sanction of his principal, and Hud it could be recovered 
in an action for money had and received. 



An Agent to buy or sell a thing on behalf of his Principal may 
not, without the consent of the Principal, sell to or buy from 
himself even though he sells or buys at Current Prices. 

EOTHSCHILD v. BBOOKMAN. [ 1829 ] 

(7 L. J. Ch. (0. S.) 163 ; 5 Bligh (N. S.), 165 ; 2 Dow &amp; CI. 188 ; 

30 B. B. 147.) 

The defendant, who was also a contractor for the Prussian 
loan, being directed by the plaintiff to buy Prussian bonds, 
represented that the purchase had been made, and advanced 
money to the plaintiff on a deposit of the bonds. The plaintiff 
having subsequently directed them to be sold, the defendant, in 
settling accounts, gave him credit for the amount at the price 
of the day. As a matter of fact no actual purchase or sale was 
made by the defendant ; all he did when asked to buy was to 
transfer his own bonds to the plaintiff, and when asked to sell 
to re-transfer them to himself and credit the plaintiff with 
their market value. 

Held, that the plaintiff ought to be relieved from the 
transaction, for where an agent is employed to buy or sell 
stock on behalf of his principal, and does not at the time 
communicate to his principal that he is the vendor or pur- 
chaser, the transaction will not be permitted to stand. 



136 CONTRACT. 

An Auctioneer is the Agent of both Vendor and Purchaser to sign 
the Memoran lum of Sale at the time of the Sale, but not 
after, and he may not delegate this Authority to his Clerk. 

BELL v. BALLS. [1897] 
(66 L. J. Ch. 397 ; (1897) 1 Oh. 663 ; 76 L. T. 254 ; 45 W. E. 378.) 

An auctioneer, in a conversation with the defendant just 
before the auction, asked the defendant to give him a bid. A 
certain property was put up for sale, and the defendant bid 
£1,550, and the property was knocked down to the defendant 
at that price. At the close of the auction the defendant left the 
room. Upon his clerk calling the auctioneer's attention to the 
circumstance that the defendant had not signed the memorandum 
of agreement, a messenger was sent after him, and he returned and 
was asked by the auctioneer to sign the memorandum, but refused 
on the ground that he made the bid for the auctioneer, and in 
compliance with his request, and not for himself. The auc- 
tioneer's clerk had in the meantime filled up the memorandum 
of agreement printed on a copy of the particulars and conditions 
of sale, which was as follows, the words in italics being those 
which were inserted in writing by the clerk in the printed 
form : — 

" I, Geo. Balk, of Brixton Hill, 8. IF., do hereby acknowledge 
that I have this day purchased the property described in the 
within particulars of sale for the sum of £1,550, and having 
paid into the hands of Messrs. Herring, Son and Daw, the 
auctioneers, the sum of £155 as a deposit and in part payment 
of the purchase-money, I hereby agree and bind myself, my 
heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns to pay the balance 
of the said purchase-money, and complete the said purchase in 
all respects according to the within conditions of sale, as witness 
my hand this 25th day of November, 1895. 

" Purchase-money - £1,550 

" Deposit 155 

" Balance - - - 1,395 



AGENCY. 137 

"As agents for the vendors, Peter Bell and William Dickson, 
we hereby ratify this sale, and as auctioneers acknowledge to 
have received the said deposit." 

Neither the clerk nor the auctioneer signed the memorandum. 
A week later, on December 2, 1895, the auctioneer, at the 
instance of the vendors, filled up and signed in the name of his 
firm, and as agent for the defendant, a memorandum of agree- 
ment on another copy of the particulars and conditions of sale. 

An action was brought by the vendors claiming specific per- 
formance of an agreement for sale. 

Held, the auctioneer is the agent of the purchaser as well 
as of the seller, and has authority to sign a memorandum 
of the sale so as to bind both parties. The signature of the 
purchaser must, however, be ivritten at the time of and as 
part of the transaction. The auctioneer 's clerk cannot, in 
the absence of special authority from the purchaser, fill up 
a memorandum on behalf of the purchaser so as to bind him, 
and the exigencies of the case do not require that the auc- 
tioneer should be held entitled to delegate to his clerk the 
authority which he himself has to bind the purchaser by 
writing down his name on a copy of the particulars and 
conditions of the sale. 

If the first memorandum on a copy of the particulars 
had been filled up by the auctioneer with his oivn hand in 
the same way as it was filled in by the clerk, it would have 
been sufficient. The first memorandum being defective by 
reason of not having been filled up by the auctioneer himself, 
and the second by reason of the authority of the auctioneer 
to sign for the purchaser having expired, there was no 
memorandum to satisfy the Statute of Frauds, and the 
action therefore failed. 



138 CONTRACT. 

An Agent for a Foreign Principal is personally liable on all 
Contracts, and has no Authority to pledge the Credit of his 
Principal. 

DIE ELBINGEE, &amp;c. v. CLAYE. [1873] 
(42 L. J. Q. B. 151 ; L. E. 8 Q. B. 313 ; 28 L. T. 405.) 

The plaintiffs, a German company, instructed their agents, 
Seebeck &amp; Co., to obtain certain wheels in England. They 
placed the order with the defendants. The wheels not having 
been supplied in time, the plaintiffs brought this action against 
the defendants. 

Held, that no action lay, for where a foreign person in- 
structs his English agents to contract on his behalf, the 
person contracting with the agent is not, in the absence of 
express agreement, although he knew for whom the goods 
were intended, liable to an action for breach of contract at 
the suit of the principal. 

Held also, an agent for a foreign principal has no 
authority to pledge the credit of his principal. 



A Person who contracts as an Agent without Authority to do so 
is liable on an implied Warranty of Authority for Injury 
sustained by a Third Party acting upon it, even though he 
honestly believes he has Authority. 

COLLEN v. WEIGHT. [1857] 
(27 L. J. Q. B. 215 ; 8 El. &amp; Bl. 647 ; 4 Jur. (N. S.) 357 ; 6 W. E. 

123.) 

Wright, professing to act as the agent of a Mr. Gardner, 
entered into an agreement for a lease of a farm from Gardner 
to the plaintiff. The plaintiff was not aware that the defendant 
had no authority from Gardner, and he proceeded to considerable 



AGENCY. 139 

xpense in preparing the farm for cultivation. Mr. Gardner 
refused to recognise the lease, whereupon the plaintiff, relying 
upon Wright's statement, brought an action against Gardner 
for specific performance. This action failed, as it was proved 
that Wright had no authority to grant the lease on behalf of 
Gardner. Wright having died, the plaintiff brought this action 
against his executors. 

Held, that the plaintiff was entitled to damages for 
or each of an implied warranty of authority, and that he 
was entitled to the cost of the Chancery suit and other 
expenses to which he had been put. Where a person in- 
duces others to contract with him as the agent of a third 
party by an unqualified assertion of his being authorized to 
act as such agent, he is answerable to the person toho so con- 
tracts for any damages he sustains by means of the assertion 
of the authority being untrue, even though the professed 
agent honestly thinks that he has authority. 



Undisclosed Principal is liable on a Contract entered into by his 
Agent even though the other Party believed at the time of 
entering into the Contract that the Agent was the Principal. 
Where a Seller, knowing who the Principal is, yet debits the 
Agent, he cannot recover from the Principal. 

DAVENPOKT v. THOMPSON. [1829] 
(7 L.J. K. B. (0. S.) 134; 9B. &amp; C. 78; 4M. &amp; Ey. 110.) 

The defendant employed one Thomas M'Kune as his agent 
in Liverpool. M'Kune acted in the same capacity for several 
other persons. One day M'Kune received a letter from the 
defendant instructing him to procure for him certain goods. 
M'Kune accordingly went to the plaintiffs and told them he had 
received an order from one of his clients, whose name he did 



140 CONTRACT. 

not mention. The plaintiffs supplied the goods, and debited 
M'Kune with the cost. M'Kune having failed, the plaintiffs 
brought this action against the defendant, who refused to pay 
on the ground that, although the plaintiffs knew the buyer 
to be an agent, they had elected to give credit to the agent, and 
could not recover from the undisclosed principal. 

Held, that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover, for where 
the seller knows that the buyer is an agent, but does not 
know the name of his principal, he may afterwards, on dis- 
covering who the principal is, compel payment from the 
principal, unless payment has been made by him to the 
agent in the meanwhile. 

Held also, if the seller, knowing who the principal is, yet 
debits the agent as the person to whom he gives credit, he 
cannot afterwards resort to the principal, although the latter 
may not have paid the agent. 

Held further, v)here a person sells goods to another, not 
knowing at the time that the buyer is an agent, the seller, 
upon afterwards discovering the principal, may resort to him 
for payment, although lie had debited the agent ; and he 
may recover against the principal, unless the latter has in 
I he meantime paid the agent. 



Agent's Knowledge is Knowledge of the Principal. 

BAWDEN v. LONDON, EDINBURGH AND GLASGOW 
ASSURANCE COMPANY, Ltd. [1892] 

(61 L. J. (I B. 792 ; (1892) 2 Q. B. 534 ; 57 J. P. 116— C. A.) 

The defendants insured Bawden for the sum of 500/. against 
permanent total disablement, and for the sum of '250/. against 
permanent partial disablement. " Permanent total disable- 
ment " was defined to mean (inter alia) " the complete and 



AGENCY. 141 

irrecoverable loss of sight in both eyes," and "permanent 
partial disablement " " the complete and irrecoverable loss of 
sight in one eye." The assured being illiterate, the proposal 
form had been filled up by an agent of the defendants. The 
form stated that the assured had no physical infirmity, although 
he had in fact entirely lost the sight of one eye. The agent 
was aware of this circumstance, but did not inform the 
defendants of it. The assured having met with an accident to 
his second eye, resulting iu his losing the sight of it, shortly 
afterwards died, and his administratrix brought an action 
against the defendants to recover 500/. for permanent total 
disablement. 

Held, that the knowledge of the agent that the assured 
had only one eye at the date of the proposal must be imputed 
to the defendants, and that under the circumstances the 
policy must be taken to be an assurance against total loss 
of sight by an accident, and that the defendants were there- 
fore liable as for a permanent total disablement. 



Death of Principal determines Agency, and no one is liable on 
a Contract entered into by a Person as Agent without 
Knowledge of Death of Principal. 

SMOUT v. ILBEEY. [1843] 
(12 L. J. Ex. 357 ; 10 M. &amp; W. 1.) 

Mr. Ilbery having departed on a voyage to China many years 
ago, when the facilities for communications were of the worst 
description, it was not till a year after his departure that 
Mrs. Ilbery learnt of his death, and that she had been a widow 
for the preceding six months. 

In her husband's absence she had not troubled to pay the 
butcher's bill. The plaintiff who had supplied the meat was 



142 CONTRACT. 

clearly entitled to lie paid for the meat which had been supplied 
while t lie husband was alive, for the wife had bound her 
husband's estate by pledging his credit for necessaries, but as 
regards the meat supplied after the death of the husband 
the position was by no means clear. The butcher was, there- 
fore, obliged to bring an action to recover the value of the meat 
supplied to the widow from the date of her husband's death up 
to the time she knew of it. 

Held, the widow was not liable for goods supplied to her 
after her husband's death, and before it was possible that 
the knowledge of his death could have been communicated to 
her, she having originally had full authority to contract, 
and having done no wrong in representing that authority as 
continuing. 

Note. — This case is distinguishable from Kelner v. Baxter, supra, 
p. 134, where persons who contracted on behalf of a non-existent prin- 
cipal were held personally liable, inasmuch as in Smout v. Ilbery 
the widow had once had authority to pledge her husband's credit. 



A particular Agent may not act beyond the scope of his apparent 
Authority. A Person is not liable for Work done without 
his Request although he has had the Benefit thereof. 

COX o. THE MIDLAND COUNTIES EA1LWAY CO. [1849] 
(18 L. J. Ex. 65; 3 Ex. 268; 13 Jur. 65.) 

An accident having taken place on the railway of the defen- 
dant company, the station-master of Birmingham obtained the 
services of the plaintiff, an eminent hospital surgeon. The 
plaintiff having performed the operation successfully, brought 
this action to recover his fee from the defendants. 

Held, it is not incident to the employment of a guard or

company may have enjoyed the benefit oj the contract. 



An Authority to do a thing, coupled with an Interest in the Donee

IN EE OAEMICHAEL. [1896] 

(65 L. J. Ch. 902; (1896) 2 Ch. 643; 75 L. T. 45— C. A 

In consideration of an agreed commission, Carmichael entered 
into an underwriting contract with Phillips to subscribe for a 
certain number of shares in a conrpany, and agreed that the 
contract should be irrevocable, and by the same document 
authorized Phillips to apply for shares in his name. Phillips 
was a vendor of certain property to the company, and one of 
the objects of the contract was to provide funds for the purchase 
of the property. Carmichael repudiated the authority previous 
to the allotment of shares. Phillips nevertheless applied for 
the shares on Oarmichael's behalf, and they were duly allotted. 

Held, that the authority was irrevocable, and that 
Carmichael ivas not entitled to have his name removed from 
the register of members of the company in respect of shares 
allotted to him in pursuance of an application made in his 
name by Phillips, for where an agreement is entered into on 
a sufficient consideration whereby an authority is given 
ivhich secures some benefit to the donee of the authority, such 
an authority being coupled with an interest is irrevocable.

THE NATURE OF A TORT. 



Injuria sine damno constitutes a good cause of action. 

ASHBY v. WHITE. [1703] 
(1 Sm. L. C. 240 ; 2 Lord Eaym. 938.) 

Ashby desired to vote at a certain election at Aylesbury, but 
the defendant, who was the returning officer, rejected the vote. 
The candidate Ashby wished to vote for proved successful, but 
notwithstanding that, the plaintiff sued the defendant for 
damages. The defendant contended that the plaintiff had 
suffered no injury, and even if he had suffered any it was so 
small that the maxim de minimis non curat lex applied. 

Held, the plaintiff was entitled to succeed, for ubi jus ubi 
remedium, and although no damage could be proved, net a 
legal right having heen infringed, the plaintiff was entitled 
to damages for breach thereof. 



Damnum sine injuria constitutes no cause of action. 

CHASEMOEE v. EICHAEDS. [1859] 

(29 L. J. Ex. 81 ; 7 H L. Cas. 349; 5 Jur. (N. S.) 873 ; 

7 W. E. 685.) 

The plaintiff and the previous occupiers of his mill had been 
in the habit for the past seven vears of utilising the Eiver 



THE NATURE OF A TORT. 145 

Wandle, which was about a mile from Croydon, for the purpose 
of working the mill. In 1851 the Local Board of Health, 
who were the owners of the adjacent land, dug a deep well on 
their own land, and thereby diverted the underground waters, 
not known to be formed into a stream flowing in a defined 
channel, which otherwise would have percolated into the river, 
and by pumping it up supplied the town of Croydon with 
water. The plaintiff sued for damages caused by this diversion 
of water from his mill. 

Held, that the defendants were entitled to use the tvater 
which percolated through their land in the manner the// had 
done, and that although the plaintiff had suffered loss, /jet il 
was a case of damnum sine injuria, and no action lay. 

Note.— Win to underground stream is of a permanent character 
and runs in a defined course, the above does not apply, and the 
landowner is onlv entitled to reasonable user of the water. 



A Landowner has a right to Appropriate Water Flowing under 
his Land in undefined Channels, but not to Pollute it where 
it is also the Source of Supply of Another. 

BALLARD v. TOMLINSON. [1885] 

(54 L. J. Ch. 454 ; 29 Ch. D. 115 ; 49 J. P. 692 ; 52 L. T. 942 ; 
33 W. E. 533.) 

The plaintiff and the defendant had each a well on his own 
land, that of the plaintiff being the deeper of the two. The 
defendant turned sewage into his own well which percolated 
through the soil, and polluted the water which the plaintiff 
pumped up from his well. 

Held, that the plaintiff was entitled to an injunction 
restraining the defendant from thus polluting the water 
which formed the source of sup pig of the plaintiff s well. 

J. L 



14(i TORT. 

Although there is before appropriation no property in 
underground water flowing in no defined channel, but per- 
colating the ear///, and forming the common source from 
ivhich all una/ appropriate water by drawing il up through 
their own laud, yet every owner of land under which such 
water percolates has a right to appropriate il, and has a 
right to have it in its natural condition; and no one is 
entitled to pollute that common source by using his land in a 
way which is not the exercise of a natural right incidental 
hi the ownership of the laud. 



No Action in Tort lies for Damage not occasioned by the Volun- 
tary Act or Negligence of the Person causing the Injury. 

THE RIVER WEAR COMMISSIONERS v. ADAMSON 
AND OTHERS. [1877] 

(47 L. J. Q. B. 193; 2 App. Gas. 743; 37 L. T. 543 ; 
20 W. R. 217— II. L.) 

The defendants were the owners of the S.S. Natalian, which 
went ashore not far from the Sunderland Docks, which belonged 
to the plaintiffs. The tide was low at the time, and as the tide 
rose the flood and storm drifted the ship against the pier and 
caused damage to the amount of 2,825/. 13s. This amount the 
plaintiffs sought to recover. 

Held, the injury not having been occasioned by the 
voluntary act or the negligence of the defendants, or any 
person on board of or connected with the ship, and not being 
prevented by any human instrumentality, teas occasioned by 
a vis major — namely, by the act of God in the violence of 
the ten/pest. The defendants were therefore not liable for 
the damage caused. 



THE NATURE OF A TORT. 147 

A Person bringing a Dangerous Thing on to his Premises is 
Liable, if it escapes, for the Damage caused thereby, however 
Careful he may have been. 

EYLANDS v. FLETCHEK. [1866] 
(37 L. J. Ex. 161 ; L. E. 3 H. L. 330; 19 L. T. 220.) 

Messrs. Rylands caused a reservoir to be constructed on their 
own land, and they employed a competent engineer to select 
the site, and a competent constructor to construct the work. 
During the construction the contractors' workmen came upon 
some old vertical mine shafts of the existence of which no one 
was previously aware. The men filled up these shafts with soil, 
but, as it turned out, they did not exercise sufficient skill and 
care in doing so, for when the reservoir came to be filled, the 
water broke through the bottom and escaped down the shafts, 
and flowing through some old abandoned coal workings, of the 
existence of which no one was aware, which ran under lands 
belonging to a third person, flooded a colliery of Fletcher. 

Held, that Messrs. Rylands tvere liable for the damage 
sustained by Fletcher, because, if a 'person brings or accumu- 
lates on his land anything which, if it should escape, mag 
cause damage to his neighbour, he does so at his peril, and 
if it does escape and cause damage he is responsible, however 
careful he mag have been, and whatever precautions he mag 
have taken to prevent the damage. 

Note. — The same principle was applied in Crowhurst v. The 
Amcrsham Burial Board, 48 L. J. Ex. 109, where the plaintiff's 
horse was poisoned by eating off a jew tree belonging to the 
defendants, part of which projected over the plaintiff's promises.

I |X TORT. 



A Person who keeps an Animal ferae naturae does a wrongful 
Act, and is liable for all the Consequences of that Act. 
Directly a Domestic Animal becomes Dangerous, it falls within 
the Class of Animals ferae naturae. 

BAKEE v. SNELL. [1908] 

(77 L. J. K. B. 1090 ; (1908) 2 K. B. 825 ; 99 L. T. 753 ; 
24 T. L. E, 811— C. A.) 

The defendant, a licensed victualler, was the owner of a dog 
which he knew to be of a savage nature. He entrusted it to 
his barman with instructions to let it out each morning and 
bring it back and tie it up before the other servants came down. 
On one occasion the barman brought the dog back while the 
plaintiff and another barmaid were at breakfast, took it into the 
kitchen, and said, "I bet the dog won't bite anyone. Gro it. 
Bob," whereupon the dog bit the plaintiff. 

Held, the law recognises two classes of animals — animals 
ferre naturae and animals mansuetae naturae. Any 
animal of the latter class may, if it is known to its owner to 
be dangerous, fall within the former class, and anyone who 
keeps a beast of that nature does a wrongful act, and is 
liable fur the consequences of that act. 

The /"/■son who keeps a savage dog with knowledge of its 
nature is responsible for any injury it does to another person, 
notwithstanding that it was mused by the intervening 
voluntary act of a third person. The owner is hound to 
keep such an animal secure at his peril. 



THE NATURE OF A TORT. 149 

A Person bringing a Dangerous Thing on to his Premises is not 
Liable if it escapes by an Act of God. 

NICHOLS v. MARSLAND. [1875] 
(46 L. J. Ex. 174 ; 2 Ex. D. 1 ; 35 L. T. 725 ; 25 W. R. 173.) 

A heavy fall of rain flooded the defendant's reservoir and 
caused the embankments to give way, and the water rushed out 
and did damage to the plaintiff's property ; the jury found that 
there was no negligence in the construction or maintenance of 
the reservoirs, and that the flood was so great that it could not 
reasonably have been anticipated, although if it had been 
anticipated, the damage might have been prevented. 

Held, a person who for his own purposes brings on his 
land, and collects and keeps there, anything likely, if it 
escapes, to do mischief is prima facie liable, if it does 
escape, for all damage which is the natural consequence of 
Us escape ; but he can excuse himself by showing that the 
escape ivas the consequence of vis major or the act of God, 
without any default on his own part. The damages having 
been due in this case to an act of God, without the default 
of the defendant, the defendant was not liable. 



A Tortfeasor is Liable for the Natural and Probable Result of his 

Wrongful Act. 

SCOTT v. SHEPHERD. [1773] 
2 Win. 131. 894 ; 3 Wils. K. B. 403.) 

The defendant threw a lighted squib on to the stall of one 
Yates, who was selling gingerbread at a fair. A man who was 
standing by, to prevent injury to himself, took up the lighted 
squib from the stall and threw it across the market place, where 
it fell on the stall of une Ryall, who, iu order to save his own 



L50 TORT. 

goods from injury, promptly threw it away. The squib falling 
on the plaintiff, burst and put out one of his eyes. In an action 
by the plaintiff for trespass and assault, it was — 

Held, that the defendant was liable for the damage done, 
for it was the direct and immediate result of an unlawful 
act, and the intervention of involuntary agents who passed 
on the squib in order to protect themselves did not relieve 
the defendant from liability. 



A Bad Motive will not render a Lawful Act Unlawful, nor a 
Good Motive render an Unlawful Act a Lawful One. 

MAYOE OF BEADFOK1.) v. PICKLES. [1895] 

(64 L. J. Ch. 751) ; (1895; A. C. 587 ; 60 J. P. 3; 11 E. 286; 
73 L. T. 353 : 14 W. E. 190.) 

The defendant, as he lawfully might, drained his land of 
water percolating through it by uncertain channels, and therel ty 
drew off the supply of his neighbours' springs. His motive in 
doing so was not to derive a benefit himself by so draining his 
land, but to injure the plaintiff. 

Held, the defendant was not liable, this not being a case 
in which Ho' state of the mind of the person doing the act 
ran affect the right to do it if it was a lawful act ; however 
ill the motive might be, he had a right to do it. If if was 
mi unlawful act, however good hi* motive might be, he 
would have hod no right to do it. 



THE NATURE OF A TOUT. 15] 

Damages caused by a Tort must not be too remote, but must be 

the immediate and proximate Effect of the Tort. 

SHARP v. POWELL. [1872] 

(41 L. J. C. P. 95 ; L. R. 7 C. P. 253 ; 26 L. T. 436 ; 20 W. R. 584.) 

The defendant washed a van of his on the pait of the street 
opposite his coach-house, and the water so used ran along the 
gutter by the side of the street for about seventy feet down to 
the corner of another street, where, meeting an obstruction, it 
accumulated and expanded over part of the roadway instead of 
going as usual into the sewer, and, there being a sharp frost at 
the time, it shortly became frozen over. The cleaning of the 
van in the street was an offence under the Metropolitan Police 
Act (2 &amp; 3 Vict. c. 47), s. 54, sub-s. 1, but the defendant was 
not shown to have known of the obstruction at the comer, and 
if he had cleaned the van in the coach-house the water would 
also have gone into the same gutter in the street. The plain- 
tiff's horse slipped on the frozen water and was so badly injured 
that it had to be killed. 

Held, that the defendant was not liable to the plain I ill' 
for damage caused to his horse by slipping whilst passing 
over the frozen water at the corner, as such damage was too 
remote, and ivus not the immediate and proximate cause of 
the defendants act. 



OMISSION OF STATUTORY DUTY. 



The omission of a Statutory Duty does not of itself constitute a 
cause of Action where the Damage caused is not the one the 
Statute sought to prevent. 

GORRIS v. SCOTT. [1874] 
(43 L. J. Ex. 92; L. R. 9 Ex. 125 ; 30 L. T. 431 ; 22 W. R. 575.) 

The defendant having contracted to carry the plaintiff's sheep 
on board his vessel from Hamburg to Newcastle, omitted t&lt;&gt; 



152 TORT. 

provide any pens, battens or footholds for the sheep on board 
the vessel as required by an Order of the Privy Council, and 
the plaintiff alleged that by reason of this omission the sheep 
were washed overboard and lost. The Order was made under 
the powers conferred by sect. To of the Contagious Diseases 
(Animals) Ad, 1869, which imposed penalties for disobedience. 

Held) that the object of the statute being to prevent the 
introduction and spreading of contagious diseases in Great 
Britain, and not to protect owners from perils of the sea 
during the voyage, no action tag against the defendants for 
breach of the duty imposed by the statute and order. 

U'&lt;i rd v. Hobbs, p. 77, supra, is another instance of this 
doctrine. 



RELATION OF CONTRACT AND TORT. 



In an Action for Tort Privity of Contract is not necessary. 

LANGRIDGE v. LEVY. [1837] 
(6 L. J. Ex. 137 ; 2 M. &amp; W. 519; 40 R. R. 689. 

George Langridge, the father of the plaintiff, being desirous 
of purchasing a gun, went to the defendant's shop. The 
defendant had a gun which he sold to George Langridge for 
the use of himself and his sons with the following warranty : — 
%&gt; "Warranted, this elegant twist gun by ^Jock, with case, com- 
plete ; made for his late Majesty, George IV. ; cost 60 guineas ; 
can be had for 23." The plaintiff having fired the gun, it 
burst, and so injured him that bis hand had to be amputated. 
lie accordingly sued the defendant, and the jury found that 
the defendant had been guilty of a false representation, and 
had knowingly sold the gun to the father for the purpose of 
being used by the plain! ill. 



RELATION OF CONTRACT AND TORT. 153 

Held, Hi it although the plaintiff could not have main- 
tained an action upon the warranty of a contract, for there 
was no privity in that respect between the plaintiff and the 
defendant, yet he was at Mini In damages by reason of a 
false representation made by the defendant with a view that 
the plaintiff" should act upon it, and upon which the plaintiff 
actually had acted. 



An Untrue Statement does not, in the Absence of Contract or 
Fraud, give rise to any Cause of Action by a Person who, 
acting thereon, is damaged.

G8 L. T. 626; 41 W. R. 468.) 

The owner of land agreed to convey his land to a builder on 
a building lease, whereby the builder contracted to build certain 
houses to the satisfaction of the owner. The owner employed the 
defendant, a surveyor, to give certificates when certain stages 
wire reached. The plaintiff, relying upon the certificates given 
by the defendant to the owner, advanced the builder a sum of 
money on a mortgage of the buildings. It turned out that the 
defendant had negligently, but not fraudulently, given certifi- 
cates which were untrue in fact. 

Held, that the defendant owed, no duly to the plaintiff to 
exercise cure in giving the certificates, and that untrue 
statements so made, in the absence of contract or fraud, did 
not (jive rise to any cause of action by the plaintiff against 
the defendant.

(66 L. J. Q. B. 542 ; (1897) 2 Q. B. 231 ; 76 L. T. 588 ; 
45 W. E. 565.) 

The plaintiff brought an action for damages for an alleged 
libel of the plaintiff contained in a pamphlet said to have been 
published by the defendant in Brazil. The defendant, who had 
delivered a defence denying the libel, and raising certain other 
defences, took out a summons for leave to amend his defence by 
pleading that if (which was contrary to his intention) the 
pamphlet had been published in Brazil, by Brazilian law that 
publication could not be a ground of legal proceedings against 
the defendant in Brazil in which damages could be recovered. 

Held, that the plea was not a good defence, and that, in 
order that an action may lie between 'parties in this country 
in respect of an act committed in a foreign country, the act 
must be one which, if committed in this country, would be 
actionable, and one which is not innocent according to the 
law of the country /('here ir was committed ; but it is not 
necessary that it should be the subject of civil proceedings in 
that country.

The plaintiff, who was the registered proprietor of a certain 
trade mark, and a dealer in a brand of champagne introduced 
by him, and known as the " Delmonico " champagne, brought 
an action against the defendants for [inter (ilia) falsely and 
maliciously publishing certain statements imputing that he had 
no right to use his trade mark, and that the wine which he sold 
was not of the brand which it purported to be. Before trial 
the plaintiff died, and his executrix obtained leave in chambers 
to carry on the action. 

Held, that find part of the action which was for defama- 
tion of the personal character of Hatchard did not survive, 
but that part of the claim which was in the nature of slander 
of title survived^ anil could be maintained by the executrix if 
special damage were proved.

The mother of thr plaintiff was travelling on the railway of 

the defendant company, when the train in which she was met 
with an accident. The mother was then quick with child, 
namely, with the plaintiff, to whom she afterwards gave birth. 
The result of the accident was that the child when born was 
found to be permanently crippled In an action by the cripple 
the above facts were set forth in the statement of claim. 

Held, IIkiI the statement of claim disclosed no came of 
action.

In an action brought by the corporation of Manchester to 
recover damages for libel, the statement of claim alleged tbat 
the (lefendint had falsely and maliciously written and published 
wonls meaning that bribery and corruption existed in depart- 
ments of the city council, and that the plaintiff's were either 
parties thereto or culpably ignorant thereof. There was no 
allegation that the property of the corporation had been 
injured. 

Held, Ih it the action could not be maintained. A cor- 
poration at common law may maintain an action for a libel 
by ell' ih Us property is injured, but cannot sue in respect 
of a charge of corruption, for a corporation cannot be guilty 
of corruption, although the members composing il may.

8 L. T. 320; 11 W. R, 644.) 

The defendant, an infant, hired a horse for a ride on the 
road ; the owner expressly refused to allow the horse to be used 
for jumping. The defendant, however, lent the horse to a 
friend, who rode it, with the defendant's permission, across the 
fields, and at fences, in endeavouring to jump which the horse 
was injured. 

Held, the lend in;/ of the horse by the defendant to his 
friend t&lt;&gt; be used for jumping was a trespass, and was an 
actionable wrong independent of any contract, and that 
therefore the defendant, notwithstanding his infancy, was 
liable for the injury which had been done to the horse.

(17 T. L. R. 720.) 

The plaintiff', a journalist, brought an action for an alleged 
libel in the Review of the Week. The defendants, besides the 
company, were Sir Tatton and Lady Sykes. 

Sir Tatton and Lady Sykes were living apart, and Lady 
Sykes received from her husband an allowance of 4,500/. a 
year under a separation deed. 

The article was written by Lady Sykes without the know- 
ledge of her husband. 

Held, Unit, although if there hud been a divorce or judicial

he wax still liable though he and his wife had agreed to lire 
separate.

LIMPUS v. THE LONDON GENERAL OMNIBUS COMPANY. 

[1862] 

(32 L. J. Ex. 34 ; 1 H. &amp; C. 526 ; 9 Jur. (N. 8.) 353 ; 7 L. T. 641 : 

11 W. E. 149.) 

A servant employed by the defendants to drive their omnibus 
drew his omnibus across the road in front of a rival omnibus of 
the plaintiff to obstruct the passage of the latter, and in doing 
so ran against and injured the plaintiff's omnibus. The defen- 
dants' servants had express directions from their masters not to 
obstruct other omnibuses or to annoy their drivers or conductors. 
The defendants' servant said that he did it on purpose, and to 
serve the plaintiff's driver as the latter had served him. On 
the trial of the action for the injury, the judge directed the 
jury that if the defendants' driver, being irritated, acted care- 
lessly, recklessly, wantonly, or improperly, and in doing that 
which he believed to be for the interests of the defendants, then 
the defendants were responsible for the act of their servant ; 
that the instructions given by the defendants to the driver not 
to obstruct other omnibuses, if he did not pursue them, were 
immaterial as to the question of the master's liability, but that 
if the true character of the driver's act was that it was an act 
of his own, and in order to effect a purpose of his own, then 
the defendants were not responsible. The jury found for the 
plaintiff, 35/. damages. 

Held, on appeal to the Exchequer Chamber, that the 

direction was a proper one.

(30 L J. Q. B. 118; 3 El. &amp; El. 672 ; 7 .Tur. (N. S.) 280; 
3 L. T. 850.) 

The plaintiff having taken a return ticket from the London 
station of the defendants' railway, at the end of the return 
journey gave up an old half- ticket, which he had put in his 
pocket by mistake fur the right one, whereupon the ticket- 
collector took the plaintiff to the ticket office, where he explained 
how the mistake had occurred. By the instructions of the 
superintendent of the line he was subsequently arrested by a 
police inspector and constable, both of whom were in the pay 
i if the defendants. The plaintiff's story proved true, and the 
case against him was dismissed. The plaintiff having brought 
an action against the defendants for false imprisonment — 

Held, that inasmuch as the 8 Vict. c. 20 {by sects. 103, 
104y imposes a penalty on any person travelling on a rail- 
way without having paid his fare, with intent to avoid the

behalf of the company, to apprehend -sac// person until he

ablybe assumed that a railway company carrying passengers 
would, in the ordinary course of business, have on the spot 
officers with authority to determine whether the company's 
servants should or should not, on the company's behalf, 
apprehend a passenger accused of this offence, and there 
was sufficient evidence that the superintendent of the line, as 
the superior authority, was an officer having authority from 
the company to act /&gt;&gt;r Hunt in the matter ; and that the 
defendants were therefore liable for the false imprisonment 
directed by him.

POULTON v. LONDON &amp; SOUTH-WESTERN 
RAILWAY CO. [1867] 

(36 L. J. Q. B. 294 ; L. R. 2 Q. B. 534 ; 8 B. &amp; S. 616 ; 
17 L. T. 11; 16 W. E. 309.) 

By the Railways Clauses Consolidation Act (8 Viet. c. 20), 
ss. 103, 104, a penalty is imposed upon any person travelling or 
attempting to travel in a railway carriage without having pre- 
viously paid his fare, and with intent to avoid payment, and 
power is given to all officers and servants and other persons on 
behalf of the company to apprehend and detain persons com- 
mitting any such offence. A railway company had arranged 
that horses, dogs, &amp;c. going to the show of an agricultural 
society should he returned free of charge upon production of a 
certificate that they were unsold. The plaintiff brought back a 
horse by the company's line, taking only a ticket for himself. 
LTpon his arrival at his destination he gave up his ticket and 
the certificate at the station, but was called upon to pay the 
customary charge for the horse, and on his refusal he was 
detained by policemen, acting under orders from the station 
master, till a telegraphic message was received explaining the 
arrangement. 

Held, that the defendants were not liable in an action for 
false imprisonment^ as there was no evidence upon which the 
jury could reasonably find that the station master was acting 
within the scope of his authority in arresting the plaintiff \ 
for, assuming the plaintiff to ha re been guilty of the offence 
with which lie was charged, the statute gave no power to 
arrest a person fraudulently neglecting to pay the charge 
for animals or goon's, and the company could not be presumed

EAYNEE r. MITCHELL. [1877] 
(2 C. P. D. 357; 25 W. E. 633.) 

It was the duty of a carman, employed by the defendant, to 
take round beer to customers in the cart of the defendant, and 
to call for empty casks wherever they might be found, for which 
he was paid the sum of Id. per cask. One day, for a purpose of 
his own, totally unconnected with his employer's business, and 
without his permission, he took the defendant's horse and cart 
out, and on his way back collected two empty casks from a 
public-house for which he received the customary 1&lt;7. It was 
after he had collected the two casks that he met with the accident 
which injured the plaintiff's cab. 

Held, that the defendant ivas not liable, as when the 
accident occurred the carman was not acting in the course 
of his employment, for he was returning on a purpose of his 
oivn, and he did not convert his oivn private occupation into 
thr employment of //A- master /&gt;// picking up the casks of a 
customer.

An omnibus belonging to the defendants was beiDg driven 
along a public highway by Harrison, a servant of the defendants. 



LIABILITY FOR TORTS COMMITTED BY OTHERS. 163 

A police inspector, honestly thinking that Harrison was not in 
a fit state to drive the omnibus, told him he was not to drive 
any further, and that the omnibus must be driven home. There- 
upon one Veares, who had formerly been in the employment 
of the defendants as conductor only, and not as driver, volun- 
teered, and got upon the box of the omnibus and drove it home, 
a distance of about a quarter of a mile, and the conductor and 
Harrison acquiesced in his doing so. Whilst Veares was driving 
the omnibus home he drove negligently or unskilfully, and in 
consequence ran over and injured the plaintiff. 

Held, that Harrison, being employed by the defendants 
for the express purpose of driving their omnibus, had no 
authority to delegate that duty to Veares, for a servant 
cannot delegate unless there is a necessity to do so, and that 
therefore the defendants ivere not liable. 



A Tort committed on behalf of another without his previous 
Authority may be ratified by him.

(64 J. E. 548.) 

The plaintiff's goods having been illegally seized under a 
warrant of distress handed by the vestry to a bailiff, he wrote 
to the vestiy seeking reparation. The vestry replied, stating 
that their solicitors would accept service of any process they 
might deem advisable to issue. 

Held, that the reply of the vestry indicated that they 
stood by the act of the bailiff, and that therefore there was 
evidence of ratif cation by the defendants of the illegal distress, 
which entitled the plaintiff' to damages.

[1886] 

(55 L.J.Q. B. 529; 11 App. Cas. 127; 51 J. P. 148; 54 L. T. 882.) 

Mitchell owned the surface of land under which the company 
had worked out coal iu and previously to the year 18(58. Be- 
tween that year and 1871 a subsidence took place, causing 
injury to cottages belonging to Mitchell. The company, by 
agreement, repaired the injury. There was no further working 
of coal under Mitchell's land, but in 1882 a further subsidence 
took place, causing injury to other houses belonging to Mitchell. 
This further subsidence was in part caused by the working of 
coal under adjoining land, but would not have occurred but for 
the withdrawal of vertical support by the company's workings. 
Mitchell brought an action for the damage sustained in 1882. 
The company pleaded the Statute of Limitations. 

Held, that a fresh cause of action arose zvhen the injury 
occurred in 1882, for which an action could be brought, 
although more than six years had elapsed since the first 
damage mused by the company's workings.

Defamation. 

Reports of Legal Proceedings are subject to Qualified Privilege. 
They must be made bona fide, be fair, and without Malice in 
Fact. 

STEVENS v. SAMPSON. [1879] 

(49 L. J. (J. B. 120 ; 5 Ex. D. 53 ; 41 L. T. 782 ; 28 W. E. 87— 

C.A.) 

The defendant, a solicitor, conducted a case in a county court 
and sent a report of the proceedings containing matter defama- 
tory of the plaintiff to several newspapers for publication. In 
an action for libel the jury found that the report was a fair one, 
but sent with malice. 

Held, by the Court of Appeal, that no absolute privilege 
attached to the publication of a report, though a fair one, 
of proceedings in a court of justice, and that the defendant, 
having been actuated by malice in sending the report, was 
liable in the action. 

If a report in a newspaper or elsewhere is on a subject of 
general interest to the public, the occasion of publishing it is 
privileged, but the defendant must show that he used it in 
the privileged way. The report must be a correct one, it 
must be made bona fide, but it is not sufficient merely to 
prove that ; he must also shoiv that the report ivas made 
without malice in fact. 



Itili TORT. 

Malice in Law is to be inferred from the Act of making a Defama- 
tory Statement, but where the Defamatory Statement is 
prima facie excusable Malice in Fact must be proved. Malice 
in Fact denotes ill-will against a person. Malice in Law is a 
Wrongful Act, done intentionally, without just cause or 
excuse. 

BROMAUE v. PROSSER. [1825] 

(3 L. J. (O.S.) K. B. 203 ; 4 B. &amp; C. 247 ; 6 Dow. &amp; R, 296 ; 1 Car. 
&amp; P. 475; 24 R. R. 241.) 

In an action for slander of the plaintiffs in their trade as 
bankers, it was proved that J. "Watkins met the defendant and 
said : " I hear you say Bromage and Sneath's (the plaintiffs) 
bank at Monmouth has stopped. Is it true ? " — that defendant 
answered " Yes, it is ; I was told so ; it was so reported at Crick- 
howell, and nobody would take their bills, and I came to town 
in consequence of it myself " ; and that George Brown had told 
the defendant "there was a run on the plaintiffs' bank at 
Monmouth." 

Held, on an application for a new trial, malice is the 
gist of the action for slander, but is of hvo kinds — malice in 
fact, and malice in laiv : the former denoting ill-will against 
a person; the latter meaning a wrongful act, done inten- 
tionally, without just cause or excuse. In common actions 
for slander, malice in law is to be inferred from the act of 
uttering or otherwise publishing the slander, that being a 
wrongful act, intentionally done, without just cause or excuse ; 
but in actions for slander prima facie excusable, on account 
of the cause or occasion of the publishing of it, as in privi- 
leged communications respecting a servant's character, to a 
party requesting information, malice in fact must be proved. 
That the proper question to be left to the jury was, 
(1) whether the defendant understood J. Watkins as asking 
for information, and whether he had uttered the words merely 



PARTICULAR TORTS. 167 

as honest advice to J. Watkins to regulate his conduct 
accordingly; and if they were in favour of the defendant 
on that question (which would make the case one of privileged 
communication, and not of common slander) ; then, second!//, 
whether the defendant, in so doing, was guilty of any malice 
in fact. 

The application for a new trial was granted. 



In an action of Defamation, if the Words spoken could not in 
their Ordinary or Primary Meaning reasonably be read as 
Defamatory of the Plaintiff, it must be proved that there is

CAPITAL AND COUNTIES BANK v. HENTY &amp; SONS.

28 W. E. 851.) 

The defendants were brewers, and had been accustomed to 
receive in payment for beer supplied to a number of their 
tenants in Sussex cheques drawn upon different branches of the 
plaintiff bank. A dispute arose between the defendants and 
the manager of the plaintiffs' branch bank at Chichester, 
through the latter refusing to cash cheques for the defendants 
drawn upon any other of the branch banks, and the defendants 
thereupon sent round to the tenants a printed circular in the 
following terms : — " Messrs. Henty &amp; Sons hereby give notice 
that they will not receive in payment cheques drawn on any 
of the branches of the Capital and Counties Bank." In an 
action for libel the statement of claim set out the circular with 
the innuendo, " meaning thereby that the plaintiffs were not 
to be relied upon to meet the cheques drawn upon them, and 
that their position was such that they were not to be trusted to 
cash the cheques of their customers." At the trial evidence 



168 TORT. 

was given that the plaintiffs incurred a loss through the issue 
of the circular, and that the defendants, on being informed of 
it, took no steps to prevent the loss increasing. 

Held, by the Court of Appeal, that the circular according 
to Hi" ordinary or primary meaning of the language, could 
not reasonably be read as defamatory of the plaintiff's ; that 

there was no evidence upon which a jury could reasonably 
find that it had any secondary meaning defamatory of the 
plaintiffs ; that the publication of it was privileged, and 
there was no evidence of express malice on the defendants' 
part to destroy the privilege ; and therefore that the 
defendants were entitled to judgment. 



The Publication to Wife of Libel on Husband is a sufficient

WENMAN v. ASH. [1853] 
(22 L. J. C. P. 190 ; 13 C. B. 836 ; 1 C. L. E. 592 ; 17 Jur. 579 ;

The defendant, who had lodged at the plaintiff's house, on 
leaving missed a memorandum book and other articles, where- 
upon he wrote to the plaintiff's wife a letter, in which he accused 
the plaintiff of having taken them, and threatened to expose 
him if he did not return them. 

Held, inter alia, that sending the letter to thcioifc was a 
publication, for though a/an and wife are in the eye of the 
law, for many purposes, one person, yet for the purpose of 
having his feelings injured by communications made to his 
wife, the husband is a different person from the ivifc, and 
that being so, there was a sufficient publication of the libel 
in this case.

A1ZETELLY v. MUDIE'S SELECT LIBRAE Y, Ltd. [1900] 
(G9 L. J. Q. B. 645 ; (1900) 2 Q. B. 170.) 

The plaintiff had been the victim of a serious libel contained 
in a book entitled " Ernin Pacha : His Life and Work," pub- 
lished by Messrs. Constable &amp; Co. The publishers on being- 
sued for this libel settled the action by paying 1007. damages 
together with an apology and an undertaking to withdraw the 
libel from circulation, and on November 12, 1898, a notice was 
inserted in the Publishers' Circular, a recognised trade publica- 
tion, that Messrs. Constable &amp; Co. requested that all copies of 
vol. i. of " Emin Pacha : His Life and Work " might be 
returned to them immediately, as they wished to cancel a page 
and insert another one in its place. A similar notice was on 
the same date inserted in the Athenceum. 

In March, 1899, the plaintiff found that the defendants were 
lending and selling copies of the work as originally published, 
and thereupon brought the present action against them. 

Held, that the plaintiff -was entitled to damages. In 
order to escape their prima facie liability as publishers of 
the libel) the burden of proof was on the defendants to show 
that it teas not by any negligence on their part that they 
did not Inmw that the book contained a libel) and as they 
laid failed to do this the plaintiff was en filled to damages. 



The Criticism of a Published Work is not Privileged, and if it 
exceeds " Fair Comment " it is actionable, and Malice in Fact 
does not have to be proved. 

MERIVALE v. CARSON. [1887] 
(20 Q. B. D. 275 ; 52 J. P. 261 ; 58 L. T. 331 ; 36 W. R. 231.) 

The plaintiff brought this action against the defendant, who 
was the editor of a theatrical paper which contained a criticism 



170 TORT. 

on a play called " The Whip Hand," of which the plaintiff was 
one of the joint authors, on the ground that the criticisms were 
libellous. 

Held, in an action in respect of a criticism upon a pub- 
lished tvork it is not necessary to prove malice in fact, for 
such a criticism is not privileged, and is a libel if it goes 
beyond the limits of fair comment i?'respcctive of the motivi 
of the writer. " Fair comment" is such criticism which, 
in I Iir opinion of a jury, docs not go beyond that which any 
fair man, however prejudiced or however strong his opinion 
limy be, would say of the work in question.

43 W. R. 196.) 

The plaintiffs published an article containing libellous impu- 
tations upon Dr. Tibbits and Mr. Harness. In respect of this 
article, so far as it reflected upon his character, Tibbits brought 
an action against the plaintiffs. Harness maintained Tibbits in 
his action. The libels on Harness contained in the article did 
not form any part of Tibbits' cause of action, nor was any issue 
raised as to Harness's character. The action resulted in a 
verdict for the plaintiffs, and Tibbits was unable to pay their 
costs. In an action brought by the plaintiffs for maintenance — 

Held, llinl although in Tibbits 1 action questions might 
incidentally arise affecting Harness's character ; he had no 

common interest in the action, and that an action for mo in-

521 ; 16 W. R. 932.) 

The plaintiff's daughter, a minor, left his house and went 
into the service of a third party. After nearly a month she 
was dismissed at a day's notice, and the next day on her 
journey back to her father's house, was seduced by the 
defendant. 

Held, that she was constructively in her fathers service 
at the time of her seduction, as he ?uas entitled to her 
services the moment after her former service had terminated, 
and that the plaintiff was therefore entitled to damages. 



Deceit or Fkaud. 

Where a Contract is induced by Misrepresentation, the fact that 
if the other Side had used due Diligence he would have 
discovered the untruth of the Representation, is no Answer 
to a Claim for Rescission. The Onus is on the Party guilty 
of Misrepresentation to prove that the Misrepresentation did 
not induce the Contract. 

REDGRAVE v. HURD. 
(51 L. J. Ch. 113 ; 20 Gh. D. 1 ; 45 L. T. 485 ; 30 W. R. 251.) 

The plaintiff, a solicitor, inserted an advertisement in a law 
paper stating that he had a moderate practice with extensive 



172 TORT. 

connections in a populous town, and that being shortly about to 
retire would take into partnership an efficient lawyer who would 
not object to purchase his suburban residence for 1,600/. The 

defendant, another solicitor, answered the advertisement, and in 
personal interviews the plaintiff represented his business as 
bringing in about 300/. a year. The plaintiff had no regularly 
kept accounts, but the defendant inspected such papeis as there 
were relating to his business, and these appeared to show 
business done to the gross amount of about 200/. a year. The 
defendant then entered into partnership and contracted to buy 
the house for 1,600/. Afterwards, finding the practice to be 
worthless, he refused to complete the purchase of the house. 

lu an action by the plaintiff for specific performance, with a 
counterclaim by the defendant for rescission of the contract, — 

lie If/, that the defendant was entitled to rescission of the 
contract. 

When a person has been induced to enter info a contract 
by representations which turn out to be untrue, it is no 
ansiver to his claim for rescission of the contract to say that 
if he had used due diligence he tvould have discovered the 
untruth of the representations. 

Held a/so, that where misrepresentations have in fact 
been made, the inference ought not to be drawn /hat the 
party seeking relief did not rely upon them; hud that in 
order to exclude relief it must be shotvn either that the 
party seeking relief had knowledge contrary to the repre-

The statement of claim set out that the plaintiff was employed 
in the British Africa Company to serve for a year in the armed 
forces of the company. The defendants, having- secretly deter- 
mined to invade the territory of the South African Republic 
with a hostile force, induced the plaintiff to remain in the force 
after the expiration of his period of service on the representa- 
tion that the service on which they wished to employ him was 
lawful ; that as fighting would shortly take place in the said 
South African Republic between other forces, his services were 
required for the protection of women and children ; that the 
force of which he was a member would have the support of 
other lawfully-appointed forces, and that such invasion of the 
territory of the South African Republic had the sanction and 
support of Her Majesty's Government ; whereas, in fact, all the 
aforesaid representations were untrue to the knowledge of the 
defendants. Acting on and believing these statements, the 
plaintiff continued in the service of the defendants, and in 
obeying their orders received the injuries and suffered the losses 
complained of in the battle of Doornkop, and for which he 
sought to recover damages in this action. 

Held, thdl this statement of claim showed a good cause 
of action, for although if the plaintiff had known that the 
act was a wrong one he could not have recovered, for even 
an express promise of indemnity jar the commission of such 
an act is void, yet an innocent person who has, by the 
fraudulent misrepresentation of others , been induced to lake 
fart with them in the commission of a criminal offence, and 
tvho has been induced by those who procured his participa-

Causing a Mental Shock is Actionable.

(G6 L. J. Q. B. 493 ; (1897) 2 Q. B. 57 ; 76 L. T. 493 ; 

45 W. E. 525.) 

The defendant, in execution of what he seems to have regarded 
as a practical joke, represented to the plaintiff, Mrs. Wilkinson, 
that he was charged by her husband with a message to her to 
the effect that the husband had been " smashed up " in an 
accident, and was lying at " The Elms," at Leytonstone, with 
both legs broken, and that she was to go at once in a cab with 
two pillows to fetch him home. All this was false. The effect of 
the statement on the plaintiff was a violent shock to her nervous 
s} r stem, producing vomiting and other more serious and permanent 
physical consequences, at one time threatening her reason, and 
entailing weeks of suffering and incapacity to her, as well as 
expense to her husband for medical treatment of her. 

Held, the pla in I iff was entitled to damages, for a false 
s la h 'in en I made luilfully, the direct and natural effect of 
which is to cause a mental shock resulting in the illness of 
the person to whom it is made, is an infringement of the 
right to personal safety, and actionable. It is wilful 
injuria, although no malicious purpose to cause the harm 
nor motive of spite be imputed, ami its effect — illness from 
mental shock — may be, and in this case was, not too remote 
to be in law regarded as a consequence for which the speaker 
is answerable in damages.

(22 L. J. Q. B. 463; 2 E. &amp; B. 216 ; 17 Jur. 827 ; 1 W. R. 432.) 

The plaintiff, the owner and manager of Her Majesty's 
Theatre, had engaged the services of Johanna Wagner, who 
was a singer with a great reputation, for three months. Not- 
withstanding this the defendant, before the expiration of the 
three months, induced Johanna Wagner to break off her engage- 
ment with the plaintiff. The plaintiff accordingly brought tin's 
action. 

Held, the plaintiff ivas entitled to damages, for the mali- 
ciously procuring Johanna Wagner to break her contract ivas 
a wrongful act from which damages accrued to the plaintiff , 
and that the action for maliciously persuading a servant to 
quit the service of another is maintainable ivhercvcr there is, 
at the time of the persuading, a binding contract of hiring 
and service existing between the parties, whether the service 
be then actually subsisting or not.

Boilermakers in common employment with Flood, who was a 
shipwright working on wood, objected to work with him, on the 



176 TORT. 

ground that in a previous employment he had been engaged 
on ironwork. Allen, an official of the Boilermakers' Union, in 
response to a telegram from one of the boilermakers, came to 
the yard and dissuaded the men from immediately leaving their 
work, as they threatened to do, intimating that if they did so 
he would do his best to Lave them deprived of the benefits of 
the union, and also fined; they must wait till the matter was 
settled. Allen then saw the managing director, to whom he 
said that if Mood, who was engaged from day to day, were not 
dismissed the boilermakers would leave their work or be called 
out. Flood, who was engaged from day to day, was thereupon 
dismissed, and brought this action claiming damages against 
Allen. 

Held, lluil Allen in inducing the employers not to re- 
engage Flood hail v 'mini aj no legal right of Flood, done no 
unlaivful act, and used no unlawful means ; and that there- 
fore his conduct, however malicious or bad his motive might 
be, was not actionable, and that Allen was entitled to

accident occurred. No statutory duty had been neglected by 
the defendants, but there was some evidence that the crossing 



PARTICULAR TORTS. 177 

was a dangerous one, and might have been rendered safer by 
extra precautions, such as the sounding of a whistle by approach- 
ing trains and the keeping of a watchman at the crossing to 
give warning in case of danger. 

Held, that whether or not the defendants had been guilty 
of negligence, yet, as there was nothing to show a connection 
between any negligence on their part and the accident, there 
tvas no case to go to the jury, and judgment must be entered 
for the defendants. 

Where contributory negligence is alleged, the burden of 
proving it affirmatively rests upon the defendant. 



Contributory Negligence on the part of the Plaintiff is no Defence 
to an Action unless the Plaintiff might by the exercise of 
Ordinary Care at the time of the Accident have avoided it. 

DAVIES v. MANN. [1842] 
(12 L. J. Ex. 10 ; 10 M. &amp; W. 549 ; 6 Jur. 954 ; 62 B. E. 698.) 

The plaintiff having hobbled his donkey by the fore legs left 
it to graze at the side of a road. The defendant's servant drove 
along the same road on his master's business at such a pace that 
he could not pull up when he saw the donkey. The donkey 
was not able to get out of the way and was killed by the force 
of the impact. The defendant pleaded contributory negligence. 

Held, a plaintiff is not precluded from recovering for an 
injury negligently done by the defendant, by the fact that he 
himself has been guilty of unlawful or negligent conduct, 
unless he might by the exercise of ordinary care at the time 
have avoided the injury. If this tvere not so a man might 
justify driving over and damaging goods, or even over a 
person asleep on the road, or running against a carriage

have avoided it.

INDEKMAUK v. DAMES. [1866] 

(36 L. J. C. P. 181 ; L. E. 2 C. P. 31 1 ; 16 L. T. 293 ; 
15 W. E. 434.) 

The plaintiff visited the premises to test certain burners on 
the defendant's premises in accordance with a contract by the 
plaintiff's employer with the defendant. The burners were in 
the sugar-refinery, where there was a shaft for raising and 
lowering sugar, which was necessary, usual and proper for the 
business. This shaft was unfenced, though when out of use it 
might have been fenced round. The plaintiff was warned by 
the defendant's manager that the place was dangerous and 
lights not allowed, and that he should keep by a man who 
would have a light ; but having left a tool in a part of the 
refinery where he had been, he went back for it, and in return- 
ing to the man with the light fell through the shaft without auy 
fault on his part. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff. 

Held, on appeal, the plaintiff was (//fit/tut to damages. 
Whirr a person resorts to a building in the course of 
business on the express or implied invitation of the occupier, 
such person, using reasonable care, is entitled to expect the 
occupier to use reasonable care to prevent damage from 
unusual danger which lie Inioivs or ought to Jcnoto ; 
where there is evidence of neglect it is a question for the 
jury ; and in this case there was evidence for the jury 
that the plaintiff was on the defendant" s premises on busi- 



PARTICULAR TORTS. 179 

ness by his tacit invitation, that the shaft was an unusual 
danger known to the defendant, and that damage accrued to 
the plaintiff from the defendant and his servants not using 
sufficient means to avert it and warn hint of it. 



Prima facie the Occupier and not the Owner is liable for Injury 
to a Stranger from Premises being out of Repair. 

NELSON v. THE LIVERPOOL BREWERY CO. [1877J 
(46 L. J. C. P. 675 ; 2 C P. D. 311 ; 25 W. R. 877.) 

The plaintiff, a stranger to the defendants, was injured by a 
chimney-pot accidental!}' falling upon hirn from a house in the 
occupation of a tenant to the defendants. The defendants 
were under no contract with their tenant to repair, and the 
premises were not out of repair at the time they let them. 

Held, therefore, that the defendants were not liable to the 
plaintiff for the injur g he had sustained. 

Held also, that the prima facie liability of the occupier 
for repairs can only be displaced so as to make the landlord 
liable in ttvo cases : — 

1st, where the landlord contracts to do the repairs, and 
can be sued bg the tenant for not doing them. 

2nd, in the case of misfeasance bg the landlord, as, for 
instance, where he lets premises in a ruinous condition. 

The prima facie liabilitg of the occupier would not be 
altered by a custom amongst landlords to do external repairs 
in the absence of any express provision in the agreement for 
letting, since such custom would not create an obligation to 
repair, for the neglect of which they could have been sued 
by their tenant. 

Todd v. Flight, 30 L. J. C. P. 21, is often cited as the leading case 
for this principle. The above case, however, better illustrates the 
principle and its exceptions.

(74 L. J. K. B. 233 ; (1905) 1 K. B. 172 ; 53 W. R. 262 : 21 T. L. R. 

226.) 

A floor of a building was let to the plaintiffs by the defen- 
dants, who retained the roof, with gutters attached, thereto, in 
their own possession. One of the gutters became stopped up. 
The defendants had notice of its condition but delayed taking 
any steps to clear it out, owing to which delay the plaintiffs' 
floor was flooded. 

Held, the defendants were liable, for a person ?vho lets part 
of his premises, retaining the oilier part, is hound to take 
reasonable care in the user of the pari retained not to cause 
damage to the tenant in his occupation of the part let.

A passenger on board the Bushire and. one of the crew lost 
their lives by drowning in consequence of a collision with the

had anything to do with the negligent navigation of the Bushire. 

Held, that their representatives could maintain actions 
under Lord Campbell 1 s Act against the oivncrs of the 



PARTICULAR TORTS. 181 

Bernina, as the deceased were not identified with those 
guilty of negligence in navigating the Bushire, and could 
recover the whole of the damages^ as the Admiralty rale as

Campbell's Act.

(67 L. J. Q. B. 771 ; (1898) 2 Q. B. 320 ; 78 L. T. 788 ; 

46 W. E. 642.) 

The plaintiff, a boy of the age of four years, while passing 
along a highway, climbed upon a fence situate upon the 
defendant's adjoining land and separating it from the highway, 
for the purpose of looking at other boys at play on the further 
side of the fence, and not for the purpose of climbing over it. 
The fence, which was so defective as to constitute a nuisance, 
fell upon the plaintiff and injured him. 

Held, in an action to recover damages for the injury, 
that , as the plaintiff in climbing upon the fence was merely 
indulging the natural instincts of a boy of his age, and 
doing an act which the defendant ought to have contemplated 
as Ulcely to be done by children using the highway, the 
defendant was not entitled to avail himself of the defence 
that the injury was caused by the plaintiff's own act, and 
that the plaintiff iv as therejore entitled to recover. 

Note — Lynch v. Nurdin, 1 Q. B. 29 ; 10 L. J. Q. B. 73, is some- 
times referred to as the leading case of this principle.

(62 L. J. Ch. 623 ; (1893) 2 Ch. 447 ; 3 E. 489 ; 68 L. T. 662.) 

"Charley's Aunt" was iu the heyday of its popularity in 
1893, and nightly large crowds collected outside the Globe 
Theatre, of which the defendant was the manager and. lessee, 
for at least an hour before the doors opened. 

The plaintiff, who carried on a lodging house next door to 
the theatre, was seriously incommoded by the popularity of the 
play, as the long queue prevented fresh lodgers coming to her 
house. She accordingly sought to restrain the defendant by 
injunction. 

Held, Hit' performance every night at a theatre of a 
particular piece may be such a nuisance as a Court of 
equity wilt rest rain /&gt;// injunction if by reason of the attrac- 
tion of the piece, it draws together such a crowd of people 
for an unreasonable lime before the theatre doors are opened, 
as to obstruct the access to the adjoining premises. 

II having appeared from the plain! iff'* affidavit in reply 
that the nuisance hod been abated, Hie Court did not think 
fit to make any order e.eeepl that the plain//'//'* costs of the

29 W. R. 617.) 

The Metropolitan Asylum Board, a body incorporated under 
the Metropolitan Poor Act, 1867, erected a smallpox hospital 



PARTICULAR TORTS. 183 

under powers conferred by that Act, and with the sanction of 
the Local Government Board. In an action for an injunction 
and damages by occupiers of neighbouring houses, it was found 
by a jury that the hospital was a nuisance. 

Held, that the Act did not necessarily require anything 
to be done under it which might not be done without causing 
a nuisance, and that the act permitted by the statute having 
been done in such a way as to create a nuisance, the persons 
injured were entitled to damages and an injunction.

32 W. R. 711.) 

Owing to an excessive rainfall a quantity of water accumu- 
lated on the upper side of the defendants' railway embankment 
which crossed some sloping land. They, finding that the 
pressure of water was causing danger to their embankment, cut 
trenches through the embankment, and thereby caused the 
water to flow through and on to the land of the plaintiff, which 
lay at a lower level on the lower side of the embankment. In 
an action for damages for the injury thus caused to the land of 
the plaintiff, the jury found that the defendants had acted 
reasonably, regard being had to the safety of their own pro- 
perty, and that there was no negligence. 

Held, that the defendants were liable, for that what they 
had done was not to ward off a common danger, bat to 
transfer to the land of the plaintiff the danger and mischief 
already existing on their own land.

(1 Str. 504; 1 S. L. C. 343.) 

The plaintiff, who was a chimney sweeper's boy, found a 
jewel, and carried it to the defendant's shop. The defendant, 
who A\as a goldsmith, examined the jewel and took it out of its 
socket, and then offered the plaintiff three halfpence for it. 
This the plaintiff refused, and insisted upon having the jewel 
back, whereupon the defendant handed him back the socket 
without the jewel. In an action against the jeweller it was 

Held, (1) that the finder of a feivel, though he does not 
by such finding acquire an absolute property or ownership, 
yet he has such a property as will enable him to keep it 
against all but the rightful owner, and consequently may 
maintain trover.

The plaintiffs were the owners of some land on which there 
was a piece of water. Tiny employed some labourers, amongst 
whom was I he defendant, to clean the pool and clear out the

mud. Several articles were discovered in the mud, and among 
others were two gold rings found by the defendant. In an 
action by the plaintiffs against the finder to recover the rings — 

Held, the plaintiffs were entitled to the rings, for where 
an owner of land has the right to exercise a control over it, 
and to prevent unauthorised interference, and some article 
[abandoned by its true oivner) is found by a stranger, either 
upon or beneath the surface of the land, the presumption is 
that the right to possession of the article found is in the 
owner of the land, and not in the finder.

In re CHENOWETH. [1902] 
(71 L. J. Ch. 739; (1902) 2 Ch. 488 ; 86 L. T. 890; 50 W. E. 663.) 

On March 23, 1900, Francis Chenoweth died intestate as to 
four houses at Milton near Gravesend, in the county of Kent. 

The deceased left no lineal descendants, and his nearest col- 
lateral male relatives, ex parte i&gt;&lt;iimu(, living at his death, were 
two first cousins and the three sons of a deceased first cousin. 
The custom of gavelkind was assumed, according to the usual 
rule in Kent, in the absence of any evidence to prove the con- 
trary, to prevail in the manor of Milton. 

The question now proposed for the decision of (he Court was 
whether the rule of partibility in the case of lands subject to 
gavelkind was limited among collaterals to brothers and the 
issue of brothers, or whether it extended to collaterals in the 
remotest degree. 

Held, the rule of partibility with rcx/icct to gavelkind 
lands in Kent) i.e., that it descend* to nil male heirs in the 
same degree equally^ extends to 'til collaterals, however 
remote. 

Kncli of the two surviving cousins was therefore entitled 
to one-third of the property^ and (lie three sons of the 
deceased cousin were entitled to the remaining third between 
I he m. 



TENANT IN FEE SIMPLE. 187 



TENANT IN FEE SIMPLE. 



To convey land in Fee Simple by Deed it is necessary, in the 
absence of the words "and his Heirs," that the words "in 
Fee Simple " be used. The words " in Fee "in a Convey- 
ance merely give the Grantee a Life Estate. 

Re ETHEL &amp; MITCHELL'S CONTRACT. [1901] 
(70 L. J. Ch. 498 ; (1901) 1 Oh. 945 ; 84 L. T. 459.) 

Upon payment oft' by the mortgagor of a mortgage debt 
created in 1895, the property which had constituted the 
security for the debt was conveyed by the mortgagees unto the 
mortgagor " to hold the same unto and to the use of " the mort- 
gagor " in fee freed and discharged " from the mortgage debt 
secured by, and all claims and demands under, the mortgage 
deed. 

Held, under the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, 
1881, s. 51 j in order to jiass the legal estate in fee simple 
by deed in the absence of the words u and his heirs" it is 
necessary to use the words u in fee simple." If these words 
are not used, however plain the intention may be to pass the 
legal estate in fee simple, only an estate for life passes 
under the deed. 

hi the absence of either of these ivords as words of limi- 
tation in the habendum, the deed could, not operate to pass 
the legal estate in fee simple ; and that, therefore, only a 
legal estate for life passed under the deed to the mortgagor, 
leaving the legal estate in remainder outstanding in the 
mortgagees.

Words of limitation are not essential to confer a Fee Simple in

(73 L. J. Ch. 693 ; (1904) 2 Ch. 487 ; 91L.T.370; 20 T. L. R. 657.) 

T»\ an indenture of settlement dated 1831 certain copyholds 
were assured to trusters in trust for Alary Ann Tringham for 
Life, and after her decease in trust Tor her husband for his Life, 
and on the decease of the survivor in trust for all the children 
of the marriage equally, to be divide I between them as tenants 
in common. 

There were three children of the marriage, one of whom 
died, leaving her share to the other two. 

This summons was taken out to determine the question 
whether the children of the marriage took absolutely or only 
life interests. 

Held, the children became entitled to equitable estate* in 
customary fee simple. 

A limitation of a trust without the word u heirs" will 
confer an equitable fee if the intention is sufficiently indicated. 



TENANT IN TAIL. 



A Writ of Elegit issued against lands of a Tenant in Tail is

not claim through him, but under a prior settlement. 

ANTHONY v. ANTHONY. [1893] 

(62 L. J. Ch. 1004 ; (1893) 3 Ch. 498 ; 3 R. 671 ; 69 L. T. 300 ;

Lands of which a testa! or was actual tenant in tail in pos- 
session were in his Lifetime delivered in execution under a writ 



TENANT IN TAIL. 189 

of elegit to his judgment creditors. After the death of the 
testator without is me the lands descended to H. W. Anthony 
under the original entail. The question aro&amp;3 whether the tes- 
tator's residuary personal estate or the entailed lands in the 
handy of H. W. Anthony were primarily liable to satisfy the 
judgment debt. 

Held, that although the Judgment Act, 1888 (1 cV 2 Vict, 
c. 110), s. 13, expressly extends to land of which the judg- 
ment debtor is tenant in tail, and the charge is enforceable 
against successors in titie not claiming through, him, but 
under a prior settlement, yet in tins case, as between the 
testator's estate and II. W. Anthony, the testator's estate 
was primarily liable. 



LIFE ESTATE. 



A Tenant for Life unimpeachable for waste is entitled to 
Proceeds of Ornamental Timber where properly cut, but 
must not commit wanton waste. 

BAKER v. SEBRIGHT. [1879] 
(49 L. J. Ch. 65; 13 Ch. D. 179; 41 L. T. 614; 28 W. R. 177.) 

The defendant was equitable tenant for life unimpeachable 
for waste of property known as the Beach wood Estate. The 
defendant cut some ornamental timber which was necessary 
for the preservation of the ornamental timber left standing. 
The trustees of the estate claimed to be entitled to the proceeds 
of the timber on the ground that cutting ornamental timber 
was waste even when done by a tenant for life unimpeachable 
for waste. 

Held, the defendant tvas entitled to the proceeds of the 
timber, for a tenant for life unimpeachable for ujaste is 



190 REAL PROPERTY AND CONVEYANCING. 

absolutely entitled to the proceeds of sale of ornamental 
timber which has been cut by him, if the cutting teas 
properly 'tone and essential for the preservation of the 
rest of the timber. 

A tenant for life unimpeachable for waste has the abso- 
lute power and dominion over the timber upon the estate, 
but the Court controls him in the exercise of that power 
upon the ground that it will not permit an unconscientious 
use to be made of a legal power. 

By the Judicature Act, 1873, s. 25 (3), a tenant for life unim- 
peachable for waste may not commit equitable waste unless special 
power to do so is given by instrument creating such estate. 



Sanction of Court to the sale of a Settled Heirloom will only be 
granted where it is for the benefit of the Estate as a whole. 

Re HOPE. [1899] 

(68 L. J. Ch. 625 ; (1899) 2 Oh. 679 ; 81 L. T. 141; 47 W. K. 641— 

C. A.) 

Lord Francis Hope, avIio was a tenant for life in possession 
of the estates settled by the will of his grandmother, applied 
I'm' the sanction of the Courl to the sale of a settled heirloom. 
Certain chattels were by the will settled as heirlooms, and 
a mongsj them was a blue Indian diamond I I ' carats in weighl . 
known a- the " Hope diamond. 

Held, the application must be refusal. When a tenant 
for life applies to the Court under sect. 37 of the Settled 
Lund Ail. 1882, for leave to hell heirloom*, he must show 
some reason why the Court should sanction the sale. The 
fa&lt;d that he has involved himself in pecuniary difficulties is 
//of a cir' umsiance which ought to have weighl in deciding 
in favour if a sole. 



EQUITABLE ESTATES FUTURE ESTATES. 191 

In considering whether its sanction should be given to a 
sale of heirlooms, the Court ought to look at all the circum- 
stances — the settlement., the intention of the settlor — and 
consider -whether it would he for the benefit of the estate as 
a whole that the heirlooms should be sold.

TYEEEL'S CASE. [1557] 
(Dyer, 155 ; 1 And. 37 (pi. 96), 313; 2 And. 136.) 

Jane Tyrrel, for the sum of 400/. paid by G. Tyrrel, her 
son and heir apparent, by indenture enrolled in Chancery, bar- 
gained and sold to G. Tyrrel to the use of the bargainor 
(Jane Tyrrel) for life, remainder to the use of G. Tyrrel in 
tail, remainder to the use of the right heirs of the bargainor. 
The question arose whether the limitation of these uses was 
had. 

Held, the habendum was void, for there cannot be a use 
upon a use, and G. Tyrrel therefore held the land in fee. 



FUTURE ESTATES. 



According to the Rule in Shelley's Case a Gift to A. for life, and 
after his Death to his heirs, creates a fee simple in A., and

VAN GEUTTEN v. FOX WELL. [1897] 
(66 L J. Q. B. 745; (1897) A. C. 658; 77 L. T. 170— H. L. (E.).) 

William Harris devised an estate to trustees in trust in case 
he should leave only one child (an event which happened) to 



192 REAL PROPERTY AND CONVEYANCING. 

permit such child to receive the rents and profits for her 
natural life, and after tier death to stand possessed of the estate 
unto the use of the heirs of the body of such child. 

The testator died leaving one daughter, Mary, who, 
treating the property as an estate tail, duly barred the entail. 

On the death of Mary, her heir claimed to be entitled to the 
property on the ground that it was a fee simple at her death. 

The heir of William Harris (a) claimed to be entitled on 
the ground that Mary had only held a life estate. 

Held, that the rule in Shelley's Case applied, and that the 
will created an estate tail which, having been duly disen- 
tailed by Mary, tvent to her heirs. 

Note. — The rule in Shellei/s Case is as follows: — "It is a rule 
in law, when the ancestor by any gift or conveyance takes an estate 
of freehold, and in the same gift or conve} r ance an estate is limited 
either mediately or immediately to his heirs in fee or in tail, that 
always, in such cases, 'the heiis ' are words of limitation of the 
estate and not words of purchase." In other words, the estate 
which the ancestor takes is described and nothing is given to the 
heirs. 



A Devise to a person and his children, or issues, who has no issue 
at the time of the Devise, is an estate tail ; if that person 
has issue at the time of the Devise, he and his issue take 
joint estates. 

WILD'S CASE. [1599] 
(6 Coke, 16.) 

Land was devised to A. for life, the remainder to B. and the 
heiis of his body, the remainder to " Rowland Wild and his 
wife," and after their decease to their " children," Rowland 

(a) William Earris having died before 1S33, his heir would be traced 
according to tin- old law, 



FUTURE ESTATES. 193 

Wild and his wife then having issue a son and daughter ; and 
afterwards the devisor died, and after his decease A. died, B. 
died without issue, Rowland Wild and his wife died, and the son 
had issue a daughter, and died. The question was whether 
this daughter should have the land or not, and it depended only 
upon the consideration what estate Rowland Wild and his wife 
had, viz., if they had an estate tail, or an estate for life with 
remainder to their children for life. 

Held, that Roivland Wild and his wife had but an estate 
for life with remainder to their children for life, and no 
estate tail. 

A devise to a person and his children or issue, zvho has 
no issue at the time of the devise, is an estate tail ; if he 
has issue at the time of the devise, he and his issue take 
joint estates. 



A Contingent Remainder must not offend the Rule against 
Perpetuities. 

Re ASHFORTH, SIBLEY v. ASHFORTH. [1905] 

(74 L. J. Ch. 361 ; (1905) 1 Ch. 535 ; 92 L. T. 534 ; 53 W. R. 328.) 

The testatrix, who died in 1864, devised her real estate to her 
three children for their lives, and then to their children for their 
lives, with remainder to the last survivor of her children's 
children in fee simple. 

Two of the children of the testatrix died without leaving

1870, leaving three children, the present plaintiffs, surviving

Held, the ride against perpetuities is applicable to legal 
contingent remainders, and as the remainder to the last 
survivor of George M. Ashfortli's children might not take

RIGHT OVER LAND IN THE POSSESSION 
OF OTHERS. 



The lateral Support of Buildings by the land of another is 
obtained by Twenty years' Enjoyment of the Support or 
by Grant. 

DALTON v. ANGUS. [1879] 
(50 L. J. Q. B. 689 ; 6 App. Cas. 740 ; 46 J. P. 132 ; 44 L. T. 844 ; 

30 W. E. 191.) 

The house of the plaintiffs, Messrs. Angus, had stood for con- 
siderably more than twenty years. The Commissioners of Her 
Majesty's Works and Public Buildings owned a house which 
directly adjoined the plaintiffs' house. The Commissioners 
employed Messrs. Dalton to pull down and rebuild their house, 
and Messrs. Dalton employed a sub-contractor, who by remov- 
ing the soil from the foundations let down the plaintiffs' house. 

Held, the plaintiffs tvere entitled to damages for the letting 
down of their house. Where the oivner of land builds a house 
on the extremity of his land, the house acquires at the end 
of tiventy years a light to the lateral support it derives from 
the adjacent soil belonging to another proprietor, by reason 
of sect. 2 of the Prescription Act (2 Sf 3 Will. IV. c. 71). 



RIGHT OVER LAND IN POSSESSION OF OTHERS. 19o 

An indefeasible Right to the access and use of Light by Prescrip- 
tion can only be obtained where the enjoyment has been 
without leave in writing for the Twenty years next preced- 
ing the Action or Claim brought to determine the same. 

HYMAN v. VAN DEN BEKGH. [1907] 
(76 L. J. Ch. 554 ; (1907) 2 Ch. 516 ; 97 L. T. 297.) 

In 1877 the plaintiff erected a cowshed the windows of which 
overlooked the defendants' field. In 1898 the defendants 
instructed their surveyor to obstruct the windows. 

The cowshed was then in the tenancy of Cox, who, not know- 
ing that an easement had been acquired, wrote the following 
letter to the surveyor : "Memorandum. Dear Sir, — I will give 
you one shilling per annum for the use of those eight lights you 
have boarded up in my cowshed. — Yours truly, John Cox." 
The surveyor did not acknowledge the letter, but had it stamped 
as an agreement, and the judge found as a fact that in reliance 
on it he refrained from erecting the obstruction. He did not 
demand payment of the shilling a year till June 5, 1903, when 
he wrote a letter to Cox asking for the arrears to date. Cox 
took no notice of the letter, and the shilling a year was never in 
fact paid. 

Held, the plaintiff had not acquired an indefeasible right 
to the easement claimed. 

Hoivever long the period of actual enjoyment of the access 
and use of light may be, no absolute or indefeasible right to 
it can be acquired under the Prescription Act, 1832, till 
the right is brought in question in some action or suit ; and 
until it is so brought in question the enjoyment relied on 
must be enjoyment for the twenty years next preceding some 
such action or suit ; in the computation of this period of 
twenty years, there must not be excluded a period during 
which the enjoyment of the light has been by some consent or 

o2 



196 REAL PROPERTY AND CONVEYANCING. 

agreement expressly given or made for that purpose by deed 
or writing. 

An agreement entered into bona fide for the piurpose of 
securing the access arid use of light to windows, and to which 
such access and use is actually due, is a sufficient agreement 
in writing within sect. 3 of the Prescription Act, 1832, if 
signed by the tenant in possession of the dominant tenement. 



Where the Owner of two Tenements conveys one to another 
Person, he does not, in the absence of Express Words, 
reserve to himself by implication an Easement for the 
benefit of his own Tenement. 

EAY v. HAZELDINE. [1904] 

(73 L. J. Ch. 537 ; (1904) 2 Ch. 17 ; 90 L. T. 703.) 

The owner of two houses conveyed one to a purchaser with- 
out reserving any right of light in respect of two windows in 
the house which he retained. The conveyance contained a 
covenant by the purchaser to permit the vendor to euter on the 
premises sold for the purpose of pointing or repairing the 
vendor's own buildings. Certain windows overlooked the 
premises of the purchaser ; one lighted a pantry on the ground 
floor, and the other a landing on the first floor ; the access of 
light to the windows was absolutely necessary for the enjoy- 
ment of the pantry and landing. The plaintiff, who claimed 
through the purchaser, blocked up the windows by a wall. The 
plaintiff asked for a declaration that he was entitled so to do. 

Held, if a vendor of land desires to reserve any rights in 
the nature of an easement for the benefit of his adjoining 
land which he has not parted with, he must, except in one 
or two cases, do it by express ivords in the deed of convey- 
ance. One of the exceptions to this rule is that of an 
easement of necessity, that is to say, where the enjoyment of 



RIGHT OVER LAND IN POSSESSION OF OTHERS. 197 

the alleged right is necessary to the property which is not 
conveyed with the adjacent land ; and in that case, the 
Court ivill consider if the reservation is to be implied 
although it is not reserved by express words. 

In this case there was no express reservation of the right 
to light, and although the light to these windows might be 
necessary to the reasonable enjoyment of the vendor's 
property, that was not enough to create an u easement of 
necessity" and the plaintiff was therefore entitled to build 
so as to obstruct the light to these two windoivs, but not so 
as to prevent the enjoyment by the vendor of the benefit of 
the covenant as to pointing and repairing. 



No man shall derogate from his own Grant. 

SWANSBOKOUGH v. COVENTEY. [1832] 
(2 L. J. C. P. 11 ; 9 Bing. 305 ; 2 M. &amp; Scott, 362.) 

The Postmaster- General being possessed of a certain piece of 
land, put it up for auction in two lots. 

The plaintiff purchased one lot with a house on it, and the 
defendant at the same time purchased the adjoining land, upon 
which an erection of one storey high had formerly stood. In 
the conveyance to the plaintiff, his house was described as 
bounded by building ground belonging to the defendant. 

The defendant erected upon his land a dwelling-house, which 
was now complained of as obstructing the light coming to 
the plaintiff's house. 

Held, that the defendant was not entitled to build to a 
greater height than one storey, if by so doing he obstructed 
the plaintiffs lights. 

It is well established by the decided cases that where the 
same person possesses a house having the actual use and 



198 REAL PROPERTY AND CONVEYANCING. 

enjoyment of certain lights, and also possesses the adjoining 
land and sells the house to another person, although the 
lights be new, he cannot, nor can anyone who claims under 
Mm, build, upon the adjoining land so as to obstruct or 
interrupt the enjoyment of those lights, for no man shall 
derogate from his own grant. 



The owner of a dominant Tenement is only entitled to such an 
amount of Light as is reasonable for ordinary occupation, 
irrespective of the particular purpose for which he has used 
the Light. A mandatory injunction will not generally be 
granted where Damages would be an adequate remedy. 

COLLS v. HOME AND COLONIAL STORES. [1904] 

(73 L. J. Ch. 484 ; (1904) A. C. 179 ; 90 L. T. 087 ; 53 W. E. 30 ; 
20 T. L. R. 475— H. L. (E.).) 

This action was brought to restrain the defendants from 
erecting on the site of 41, Worship Street any building so as to 
darken, injure or obstruct any of the ancient lights of the 
plaintiff. 

The plaintiff's premises were used as offices, and it was found 
at the trial that even after the erection of the defendants' 
building they would be well and sufficiently lighted for all 
ordinary purposes of occupancy as a place of business, but that 
if the defendants' building remained the plaintiff would have to 
consume and pay for more electric light than before. 

Held, the buildings of the defendants not having so 
materially interfered with the light previously enjoyed by 
the plaintiff as to amount to a nuisance, the p&gt;laintiff had 
no right of action. The owner or occupier of a dominant 
tenement is entitled to the uninterrupted access through his 
ancient windoios of such an amount of light as is required 
for the ordinary purposes of inhabitancy or business accord- 



RIGHT OVER LAND IN POSSESSION OF OTHERS. 199 

ing to the ordinary notions of mankind, without regard to 
the particular purpose for which he has used the light. 

An obstruction which will justify the interference of the 
Court must be of such a character as will constitute a 
nuisance. 

By Lord Macnaghten and Lord Lindley : — A mandatory 
injunction for the removal of a building obstructing ancient 
lights should not be granted in an ordinary case where 
damages would be an adequate remedy. 



The right to Light may be lost by Abandonment, but not merely 

by Non-user. 

MOORE v. RAWSON. [1824] 
(3 L. J. (0. S.) K. B. 32 ; 3 B. &amp; C. 332 ; 5 D. &amp; R. 234 ; 
27 R. R. 375.) 

The plaintiff brought this action against the defendant for 
obstructing certain lights. The plaintiff's messuage was an 
ancient house, and adjoining it there had formerly been a 
building in which there was an ancient window overlooking the 
land of the defendant. The former owner of the plaintiff's land 
had seventeen years previously pulled down this building and 
erected another on the same site with a blank wall overlooking 
the defendant's premises. The plaintiff just before this action 
was brought opened a window in the same place as the window 
had been in the old building. The defendant thereupon erected 
a building just opposite the plaintiff's building. 

Held, the plaintiff was not entitled to maintain this 
action, because by erecting the blank wall he not only ceased 
to enjoy the light but had evinced an intention never to 
resume it. 



200 KEAL PROPERTY AND CONVEYANCING. 

The right to the free access of Air through a defined channel may 
be the subject of an implied Covenant, but cannot be the 
subject of a Grant or Prescription. 

HALL v. THE LICHFIELD BREWERY CO. [1880] 
(49 L. J. Ch. 655 ; 43 L. T. 380.) 

The plaintiff was a butcher at Lichfield and the owner in fee 
of the house and premises where he carried on his business. He 
claimed damages from the defendants in respect of injury caused 
by the obstruction of light to certain windows of his house, and 
the obstruction of air to his slaughter-house in consequence of 
the erection of new buildings by the defendants. The slaughter- 
house had been used in the same form for upwards of thirty 
years. 

Held, that the plaintiff iv as entitled to damages for the 
breach of an implied covenant not to interrupt the free access 
of air suitable for the purpose of a slaughter-house. 
Such a right is not one that can be claimed by grant, 
because it is not a thing which is to be used by the grantee 
on the soil of the grantor ', nor can it be the subject of pre- 
scription, for prescription is the implication of a grant. 



If a Person enters upon the Land of another and holds possession 
for a time, and then, without having acquired a Title under 
the Statute of Limitations, abandons possession, the true 
Owner's Rights revive. 

TRUSTEES AND AGENCY CO. v. SHORT. [1888] 

(58 L. J. P. C. 4 ; 13 App. Cas. 793 ; 59 L. T. 677 ; 37 W. R. 433 ; 
53 J. P. 132— P. C.) 

The plaintiff company brought this action in ejectment to 
recover fifty acres of land which was situated in Botany Bay, 
New South Wales. 



LEASEHOLDS. 201 

The land in question was some open bush land of which the 
plaintiff company had obtained a grant from the Government in 
1810. In 1848 one William Meredith entered into possession 
of the land, but abandoned the same five years later. 

In 1883 the defendant took possession of the land, claiming" 
the same as a purchaser from William Meredith. 

The defendant contended that, as the plaintiffs had not 
entered upon the land for more than twenty years, nor exercised 
any of the rights of ownership, they were debarred under the 
Statute of Limitations (3 &amp; 4 Will. 4, c. 27), which was adopted 
in New South Wales, from claiming the land. 

Held, the plaintiffs were entitled to the land. 

If a person enters upon the land of another, and holds 
possession for a time, and then, without having acquired title 
under the Statute of Limitations, abandons possession, the 
rightful owner on the abandonment is in the same position in 
all respects as he was before the intrusion took place. 



LEASEHOLDS. 



A Person in Possession under an Agreement for a Lease of which 
Specific Performance would be granted, holds under the same 
terms as if the Lease had been granted. 

WALSH v. LONSDALE. [1882] 
(52 L. J. Ch. 2 ; 21 Ch. D. 9 ; 46 L. T. 858 ; 31 W. E. 109.) 

In 1879 the defendant agreed in writing to grant the plaintiff 
the lease of a mill for seven years, with a stipulation that each 
year's rent was to be payable in advance on demand. 

The plaintiff went into possession and paid rent at the end 
of each quarter to the 1st January, 1882. 

In March, 1882, the defendant demanded payment of 1,005/., 



202 REAL PROPERTY AND CONVEYANCING. 

partly for the rent already due and partly for one year's rent in 
advance, and put in a distress. 

The plaintiff thereupon brought this action for illegal distress, 
upon the ground that he did not hold under a lease, but merely 
an agreement for a lease, which in law only constituted a 
tenancy from year to year ; and that there could be no distress 
unless there was a legal tenancy and the rent in arrear. 

Held ', per Jessel, M. R., that there had been no illegal 
distress. 

" There is an agreement for a lease under which possession 
has been given. 

" Now j since the Judicature Act the possessio?i is held 
under the agreement. There are not two estates as there 
tvere formerly , one estate at common law by reason of the 
payment of the rent from year to year, and an estate in 
equity under the agreement. There is only one Court, and 
the equity rules prevail in it, and the tenant holds under an 
agreement for a lease. He holds, therefore, under the same 
terms in equity as if a lease had been granted, it being a 
case in which both parties admit that relief is capable of 
being given by specific performance. That being so, he 
cannot complain of the exercise by the landlord of the same 
right as the landlord would have had if a lease had been 
granted. On the other hand, he is protected in the same 
way as if a lease had been granted ; he cannot be turned out 
by six months' 1 notice as a tenant from year to year. He 
has a right to say, i I have a lease in equity, and you can 
only re-enter if I have committed such a breach of covenant 
as ivould, if a lease had been granted, have entitled you to 
re-enter according to the terms of a proper proviso for re- 
entry? That being so, it appears to me that, being a lessee 
in equity, he cannot complain of the exercise of the right of 



LEASEHOLDS. 203 

distress merely because the actual parchment has not been 
signed and sealed. 1 '' 



What constitutes good Tenantable Repair depends on the age and 

locality of Premises and the class of Persons likely to require 

them. 

PEOUDFOOT v. HAET. [1890] 

(59 L. J. Q. B. 389 ; 25 Q. B. D. 42 ; 63 L. T. 171 ; 38 W. E. 73U ; 

55 J. P. 20.) 

The action was brought to recover damages for breach of an 
agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant, whereby the 
defendant agreed to rent a house at 551. per annum, and to keep 
the demised premises in good tenantable repair and so to leave 
them at the expiration of the term. The question that had to 
be decided was, what constituted good tenantable repair. 

Held, u good tenantable repair'' 1 in an agreement by a 
tenant to keep and leave demised premises in good tenantable 
repair means such repair as, taking into account the age 
and character of the premises and the locality in which they 
are situated, a reasonable tenant of the class of persons who 
would be likely to require such premises might reasonably 
require in order to fit the premises for occupation. 

A tenant tvho agrees to " keep " premises in good tenant- 
able repair is not excused from doing so by reason that the 
premises were not in good tenantable repair at the time of 
the demise. He must in that case put the premises in good 
tenantable repair.

COVENANTS WHICH II UN WITH THE LAND. 



Covenants running with the Land are those under which the 
Benefits and Liabilities pass to the Assignee of the Land. 

SPENCER'S CASE, SPENCER v. CLARK. [1584] 
(5 Coke, 16; S. L. C. i. 55.) 

Spencer by deed demised land to one S. for twenty-one 
years, the lessee covenanting on behalf of himself, his executors 
and administrators, to build a brick wall on part of the demised 
land. The lessee assigned the lease to J., who in turn assigned 
it to the defendant. The wall not having been built, the 
plaintiff brought this action against the defendant, claiming 
damages for breach of the covenant. 

Held, that the defendant tvas not liable, for the original 
lessee had not covenanted for himself and his assigns; and 
as the covenant was for something to be done, the assignee 
not being bound by express toords was not liable. 

The Court unanimously laid down the following rules ivith 
regard to covenants which run with the land : — 

(1) Where the covenant extends to a thing in esse, parcel 
of the demised, the covenant runs with the land, and binds 
the assignee although he be not bound by express words, 
e.g., where the lessee covenants to keep the demised premises 
in repair. 

(2) Where the covenant concerns a thing not in esse at 
the time of the demise, but to be built on the land demised, 
the assignee is only liable where bound by express terms. 

(3) The assignee, though named, is not bound by a cove- 
nant to do something which is merely collateral, and which 
in no manner loaches or concerns the thing demised and 



COVENANTS WHICH RUN WITH THE LAND. 205 

assigned over. Thus, for instance, the assignee is not bound 
ivhere the lessee covenants J or himself and his assigns to 
build a house on the lessor's land. 

(4) Where the lessor leases any personal goods and the 
lessee covenants for him and his assigns at the end of the 
time to deliver the same in as good condition as when he got 
/hi'in, such covenant is but a personal contract and does not 
bind the assignees. 

Note. — A covenant running with the land is one in which the 
liabilities or benefits under it pass to the assignee of that land. 



Restrictive Covenants bind a Purchaser of Land who buys with 

Notice. 

TTTLK v. MOXHAY. [1848] 

(18 L. J. Ch. 83 ; 2 Ph. 774 ; 1 Hall &amp; Tw. 105 ; 13 Jut. 89.) 

In 1808 the plaintiff sold to one Elms the square plot of 
garden which is still to be seen in Leicester Square. Elms 
covenanted on behalf of his heirs, executors and assigns to pre- 
serve the garden in the same condition as it was then in, free 
from buildings. Subsequently Elms sold the property to the 
defendant, who, although he knew of the covenant, promptly 
started building operations. 

Held, the defendant was bound by the covenant not to 
build, for it zvas inequitable that Elms, who had purchased 
subject to restrictions for a lower price than he could other - 
ivise have obtained it for, should, by being able to sell it free 
of restrictions, receive full value from a third party, and 
that such third party should then hold it unfettered by the 
restriction under which it zvas granted. 



206 REAL PROPERTY AND CONVEYANCING. 



Positive Covenants do not bind a Freeholder even though he buys 
the Land with Notice. 

AUSTERBERRY v. CORPORATION OF OLDHAM. [1885] 
(55 L. J. Ch. 633; 29 Ch. D. 750; 53 L. T. 543; 33 W. R. 807.) 

The plaintiff's predecessor in title conveyed a certain piece of 
land to trustees for valuable consideration for the purposes of 
making a road, and the trustees covenanted with the vendor, 
his heirs and assigns, that they, their heirs and assigns, would 
make the road and at all times keep it in good repair. 

The trustees sold the land to the defendant corporation, 
which took it with notice of the covenant which, if binding, 
made the corporation liable to make up the road. The defen- 
dants denied that they were liable to make or maintain the road, 
whereupon the plaintiff brought this action to enforce the 
covenant. 

Held, that this covenant did not run ivith the land, and 
could not be enforced against the purchasers from the 
trustees although they took it with notice of the covenant to 
repair. 

The doctrine in Tulk v. Moxhay (supra, p. 205) is 
limited to restrictive stipulations, and will not be extended 
so as to bind in equity a purchaser taking with notice of a 
covenant to expend money on repairs or otherwise which does 
not run with the land at law. 



MORTGAGES. 207 



MORTGAGES. 



Once a Mortgage always a Mortgage. Equity does not permit 
a clog on the Equity of Redemption. 

BEADLEY v. CAEEITT. [1903] 

(72 L. J. K. B. 471 ; (1903) A. C. 253 ; 88 L. T. 633 ; 
51 W. E. 636— H. L. (E.).) 

Bradley, who held a number of shares in a tea company, 
mortgaged them to Carritt and undertook to use his best 
endeavours to secure that the plaintiff " shall always hereafter 
have the sale of all the company's teas as broker" ; and in the 
event of any of the company's teas being sold otherwise than 
through Carritt, Bradley personally agreed to pay Carritt the 
amount of the commission which Carritt would have earned if 
the teas had been sold through him. 

Carritt having called in the loan, Bradley repaid it and 
transferred the shares in the company into his own name. 

Carritt brought this action claiming damages from Bradley 
for not continuing to buy his teas through him. 

Held, Carritt was not entitled to damages, as such a 
stipulation constituted a clog on the equity of redemption, 
and was therefore invalid. 



Where several Mortgages become vested in one Mortgagee, the 
right of Consolidation can be enforced not only against the 
Original Mortgagor, but also against the Assignee of the 
Equity of Redemption. 

PLEDGE v. WHITE. [1896] 

(65 L. J. Ch. 449 ; (1896) A. C. 187 ; 74 L. T. 323 ; 44 W. E, 
589— H. L. (E.).) 

James Bank was the owner of seven different properties, 
which he mortgaged to several different persons. 



208 REAL PROPERTY AND CONVEYANCING. 

Brockraan had all these mortgages except one transferred to 
him in his lifetime, and after his death the remaining mortgage 
was transferred to his executor, White, who thus became the 
mortgagee of all seven properties. 

In the meantime James Bank had transferred the equities of 
redemption of all these properties to the plaintiff, who claimed 
to be entitled to redeem one of the properties by paying off the 
amount secured on that property only. 

The defendant claimed to be entitled to consolidate all the 
mortgages. 

Held, the defendant was entitled to consolidate all the 
mortgages, and have them all paid off. 

Where several mortgages originally vested in several 
persons for distinct sums become united in one holder, the 
right of consolidation can be enforced not only against the 
original mortgagor, but also against the assignee of the 
equity of redemption, notwithstanding that the mortgages 
which it is sought to consolidate were not united in title in 
the mortgagee ivith the mortgage which it is sought to redeem 
until after the assignment of the equity of redemption. 



Where a Charge is paid off by one other than the Mortgagor, it 
is a question of Intention of the Payer, express or implied, 
whether he meant to keep it alive. Where the Payer would 
be prejudiced by the Merger the Court will presume that it 
was intended to keep the Charge alive. 

ADAMS v. ANGELL. [1877] 
(46 L. J. Ch. 352 ; 5 Oh. I&gt;. &lt;i;)i ; 36 L. T. 334.) 

The plaintiff was the first mortgagee of certain property 
belonging to the defendant, of which J. E. Newsome was a 



MORTGAGES. 209 

subsequent incumbrancer. The plaintiff obtained judgment in 
a foreclosure action against Angell and Newsome. 

1,380/. was due to the plaintiff on the security of the mort- 
gage, and on the bankruptcy of Angell the plaintiff obtained 
from the trustee in bankruptcy an assignment of the whole 
property, including the equity of redemption, subject to the 
claim of Newsome, in consideration of the full release of the 
debt and the payment by the plaintiff of the sum of 20/. to the 
trustee in bankruptcy. The deed did not, however, in terms 
keep alive the first mortgage as a protection against the second 
mortgagee. 

The value of the property did not exceed the 1,380/. due to 
the plaintiff. 

Newsome now contended that, the plaintiff's claim as mort- 
gagee being satisfied by his having purchased the equity of 
redemption, nothing was due to him, but that there was owing 
to Newsome, as first incumbrancer, what, upon taking the 
account, should be found to be due to him. 

Held, that the intention being apparent upon the deeds 
not to let in the second mortgagee as first mortgagee, such 
second mortgagee could only foreclose on terms of paging off 
the amount secured by the first mortgage. 

The question whether a charge which is paid off is kept 
alive is one of the intention of the payer, and where he would 
be prejudiced by the merger the Court will presume that it 
ivas intended to keep the charge alive. 

Note. — An owner who " has paid off a prior incumbrance can 
never set it up against his own mortgage," per Chitty, J., Phitt v. 
Mendel, 27 Ch. D. 251.

CONTRACTS FOR THE SALE OF LAND. 



Where, by reason of a defect in Title, the Vendor of Real Estate 
is unable to convey the Property, the would-be Purchaser, in 
the absence of Fraud, is not entitled to Damages beyond his 
Deposit with Interest and Costs. 

BAIN v. FOTHERGILL. [1874] 
(43 L. J. Ex. 243 ; L. R. 7 H. L. 158 ; 31 L. T. 387 ; 23 W. R, 261.) 

This action was brought by the plaintiffs to recover damages 
for the breach of an agreement whereby the defendants agreed 
to sell to the plaintiffs their interest in a mining royalty, called 
Miss Watters' Royalty, and which they afterwards failed to sell. 

The sale fell through owing to the inability of the defendants 
to convey a good title. 

Held, the plaintiff's in the circumstances were not entitled 
to recover damages beyond, their deposit with interest and 
costs. 

If a person contracts to sell real estate and is unable to 
complete from want of title, whether he be aware of the 
defect at the time of entering into the contract and does not 
disclose it, or not, and even if he never had the title, nor 
possessio?i, nor any right to possession, yet in the absence of 
fraud the intending purchaser cannot, in an action for breach 
of the contract, recover damages beyond his deposit with 
interest and costs. 



A Purchaser or Lessee having notice of a Deed of Title to the 
Property has Constructive Notice of its Contents. 

PATMAN v. HARLAXI). [1881] 
(50 L. J. Ch. 642 ; 17 Ch. D. 353 ; 44 L. T. 728 ; 29 W. R. 707.) 

The plaintiff sold to one Herve two plots of land subject to a 
covenant that only dwelling-houses should be erected thereon. 



CONTRACTS FOR THE SALE OF LAND. 211 

Herve in turn conveyed the same land to Harland subject to 
the same covenants and conditions. Harland erected a private 
dwelling-house on the two plots and let the same to Louisa 
Jane Bennett, giving her express permission to erect in the 
garden belonging to the premises a studio, with necessary rooms 
connected therewith, of corrugated iron on a brick foundation. 
This lease also contained a covenant by the lessee not to carry on 
any trade, business or employment on the premises without the 
consent in writing of the lessor, but to use the premises as a 
private dwelling-house, " provided that the user of the said 
premises for the purposes of a school of instruction in art or 
otherwise shall not be deemed a breach of covenant." 

Neither Miss Bennett nor her solicitor, who negotiated the 
lease, had notice of the restrictive covenants. Miss Bennett 
having commenced to erect a corrugated iron structure to be 
used as an art studio in accordance with the terms of the proviso 
contained in the lease, the plaintiff moved for an injunction to 
restrain the defendants (Harland and Bennett) from continuing 
to erect, and from permitting to remain, the art studio in 
question. 

Held, per Jessel, M. R., the plaintiff was entitled to an 
injunction against the defendant Bennett to restrain the 
further erection of the building, but not to a mandator}) 
order for the removal of the studio, as it might be altered so 
as to be a reasonable adjunct to a private dwelling-house. 

A lessee has constructive notice of his lessors title, such 
notice being of the usual title deducible on a purchase, and 
he will be fixed with constructive notice of any restrictive 
covenant affecting the property, notwithstanding that he may 
have an express contract with the lessor allowing a breach of 
the restrictive covenant, and notwithstanding that a repre- 
sentation may have been made to him that the properly is 
not subject to any such restrictive covenant.

212 REAL PROPERTY AND CONVEYANCING. 

The above rule is not altered by sect. 2, sub-sect. 1, of the 
Vendor and Purchaser Act, 1874, which provides that a 
lessee shall not be entitled to call for the title to the freehold, 
the effect of the section being simply to put a lessee into the 
same position as if he had before the Act stipulated not to 
inquire into the lessoi^s title.

Equitable Relief will be granted though Property out of Jurisdic-

PENN v. BALTIMOEE. [1750] 
(1 Ves. sen. 443.) 

Disputes had arisen as to the boundaries of two American 
provinces — Penn and Baltimore. An agreement was come to 
in the matter which was contained in articles entered into 
between the plaintiff and the defendant. The plaintiff sought 
specific performance of this agreement. The defendant took 
the objection that the Court had no jurisdiction to try the 
matter. 

Held, the Court had jurisdiction, and decreed specific 
performance. 

Although the Court has no original jurisdiction on the 
direct question of the original right of the boundaries, that 
did not matter, for the proceedings were based on articles 
executed in England under seal for mutual consideration, 
which gives jurisdiction to the King's Courts, both of law 
and in equity, whatever be the subject-matter. 

Although in the present case, the land being out of juris- 
diction, the Court could not enforce their own decree in rem, 
that was not a reason against making a decree in this case, 
for the strict primary decree in this Court as a Court of 
equity was in personam, and as the parties were in 
England the decree of the Court could be enforced by process 
of contempt in personam and sequestration. 



214 EQUITY. 

Where the Equities are equal the Law prevails. Notice, actual 
or constructive, of the previous Equity prevents the Rule 
applying. 

THOENDIKE v. HUNT. [1859] 

(28 L. J. (Jh. 417 ; 3 De G. &amp; J. 563 ; 5 Jur. (N. S.) 879 ; 
7 W. E. 246.) 

Hunt was one of the trustees of two wills, i.e., Firstly, of 
that of Mrs. Linzee, who by her will gave certain stock to her 
three daughters for life with remainder to their children. 

Secondly, of that of George Vinnecombe, who by his will 
gave 8,000/. Consols to Mrs. Thorndike for her life, with 
remainder to her children. 

Hunt ultimately became possessed of both these funds, and 
sold most of the former and all the latter, and applied the 
proceeds to his own use. 

Mrs. Thorndike was the first to take proceedings, and she 
filed a bill against Hunt, and an order was made that he should 
transfer into Court the amount suld out, and he accordingly 
transferred into Court 3,253/. Consols (which, in fact, was part 
of the trust estate of Mrs. Linzee), and the dividends of these 
Consols were paid to Mrs. Thorndike for many years. 

Several years later the parties interested under Mrs. Linzee's 
will discovered what had happened, and presented a petition 
praying that the 3,253/. and dividends might be handed over 
to them. 

Held, that Mrs. Thorndike was a purchaser for valuable 
consideration without notice of the fraud, and, having the 
legal title, was entitled to hold the fund against the parties 
interested under Mrs. Linzee's will. 



EQUITABLE RIGHTS. 215 

A prior Legal Estate will be postponed to a subsequent Equitable 
Estate where the Owner of the Legal Estate has connived at 
the Fraud which led to the creation of a subsequent Equitable 
Estate without Notice of the prior Legal Estate, or where the 
Owner of the Legal Estate has constituted the Mortgagor his 
Agent with authority to raise Money, and the Estate thus 
created has by the Fraud of the Agent been represented as 
being the first Estate. Mere carelessness on the part of the 
Legal Owner will not, however, postpone the prior Legal 
Estate to the subsequent Equitable Estate. 

THE NORTHERN COUNTIES OF ENGLAND FIRE 
INSURANCE CO. v. WHIPP. [1884] 

(53 L.J. Ch. 629; 26 Ch.D.482; 51 L. T. 806; 32 W. R. 626— C. A.) 

Crabtree, who was the general manager of the plaintiff com- 
pany, executed a legal mortgage of certain freehold property to 
the company to secure a sum of money advanced to him by the 
company, and delivered up the title deeds to the company. The 
deeds were kept in a safe, of which Crabtree had a key. 
Crabtree subsequently mortgaged the same property to Whipp, 
and, having abstracted the title deeds from the safe, handed 
them over to Whipp, who had no knowledge of the plaintiffs' 
charge. 

Held, although there was great carelessness in the manner 
in which the company kept their securities, there was no 
evidence of fraud on their part, and they were entitled to 
priority over Whipp, for the Court will not postpone the 
prior legal estate to the subsequent equitable estate on the 
ground of mere carelessness or want of prudence on the part 
of the legal owner. 

The Court will, however, postpone the prior legal estate 
to a subsequent equitable estate (a) where the owner of the 
legal estate has assisted in or connived at the fraud which 
has led to the creation of a subsequent equitable estate. 



216 EQUITY. 

without notice of the prior legal estate, of which assistance 
or connivance the omission to use ordinary care in inquiring 
after or keeping title deeds may be, and in some cases has 
been, held to be sufficient evidence, where such conduct cannot 
be otherwise explained, or (b) where the owner of the legal 
estate has constituted the mortgagor his agent with authority 
to raise money, and the estate thus created has, by the fraud 
or misconduct of the agent, been represented as being the 
first estate. 



Failure to require production of Title Deeds will sometimes affect 
a Purchaser of the Legal Estate with Constructive Notice of 
an Equitable Charge if one exists. 

MAXFIELD v. BUETON. [1873] 
(43 L. J. Oh. 46 ; L. E. 17 Eq. 15 ; 29 L. T. 571 ; 22 W. E. 148.) 

Mr. Ladkin deposited the title deeds of an estate with his 
bankers, and signed a memorandum charging the estate with 
payment of a sum due from him to the bankers. He after- 
wards married, and in consideration of such marriage he settled 
the estate by articles, and shortly after marriage executed a 
settlement conveying the legal estate to a trustee. During the 
negotiations he told the lady's solicitor that he was entitled to 
the estate free from encumbrances, and that the deeds were at 
his bank for safe custody. 

Held, that the solicitor ought to have inquired of the 
bankers whether they had a charge upon the deeds, and that 
as he omitted to do so, all persons claiming under the settle- 
ment were fixed with constructive notice of the charge. 



EQUITABLE RIGHTS. 217 



Non-production of Title Deeds by Vendor after application for 
them will not always affect a bona fide Purchaser with know- 
ledge of an Equitable Charge if one exists. 

AGRA BANK, Ltd. v. BARRY. [1874] 
(L. R. 7 H. L. 135.) 

In 1865, Greorge Richard Barry, being indebted to the Agra 
Bank, handed them as security the title deeds of an estate in 
Ireland. This equitable mortgage was not registered. Subse- 
quently Gr. R. Barry was pressed by his wife to give her security 
for money he owed to her. He subsequently consented, and in 
1866 a solicitor was instructed to draw up a legal mortgage on 
the same estate. The solicitor called upon Barry for the title 
deeds, who gave as an excuse for their non-production the 
explanation that the title deeds were at his house in Ireland, 
and supplied the solicitor with a written summary of their 
contents. The solicitor, being totally unaware of the previous 
equitable mortgage, accordingly prepared the legal mortgage, 
which was duly registered. 

Held ^ that the explanation given by Barry for the non- 
production of the title deeds was a very natural, plausible 
and credible statement, and that in the circumstances, the 
solicitor not having been guilty of wilful negligence, the legal 
mortgage obtained priority over the equitable mortgage, and 
was not postponed to it by reason of the solicitor having 
acted improperly in preparing it without insisting on the 
production of the deeds. 



218 EQUITY. 

Where a Person takes a Legal Estate in Property which was once 
to his knowledge subject to an Equitable Charge, he takes it 
subject thereto, even though he was induced by Fraud to 
believe it had ceased. 

JARED v. CLEMENTS. [1903] 

(72 L. J. Ch. 291 ; (1903) 1 Oh. 428 ; 88 L. T. 97 ; 51 W. R. 401.) 

A purchaser before completion had, through her solicitor, 
actual notice of an equitable charge created by deposit of title 
deeds which her solicitor required to be paid off. On comple- 
tion, the vendor's solicitor produced the memorandum of deposit 
with a forged receipt purporting to be signed by the owner of 
the equitable charge, which, together with the title deeds, was 
handed over to the purchaser, who by the conveyance from the 
vendor acquired the legal estate. The owner of the equitable 
charge had not been guilty of negligence. 

Held, that the purchaser could not set up the legal estate 
against the equitable charge, and must hold the property 
subject to the equitable charge. 



The Rule in Dearie v. Hall lays down that where a Person having 
an Equitable Right to Property first assigns his rights to A. 
and then to B., who has no notice of the prior assignment, 
the one who first gives notice of the assignment to the Trustees 
of the Legal Estate obtains priority. 

MONTEFIORE v. GUEDALLA. [1903] 
(72 L. J. Ch. 442 ; (1903) 2 Ch. 26 ; 88 L. T. 496.) 

A Jewish lady who was entitled to a reversionary interest in 
a fund in Court after the death of her mother, married a 
Moorish Jew in Morocco, and signed a marriage contract under 
which it was alleged that according to Jewish custom her 



EQUITABLE RIGHTS. 219 

children became entitled to the fund on her death to the exclu- 
sion of the husband. The children obtained no stop order on 
the fund. The wife died before her mother, and after her 
death her husband, as her administrator, assigned the fund to 
assignees, who obtained a stop order on the fund in Court with 
notice of the marriage but without notice of the title of the 
children. After the death of the wife's mother the assignees 
claimed the fund. 

Held, following the rule laid down in Dearie v. Hall, 
that by obtaining a stop order on the fund from the lady's 
legal personal representative, the assignees became entitled 
to the fund in priority to the children. 



Where several Persons have Equitable Charges and none of them 
has the Legal Title, in the absence of Special Circumstances 
they take Priority according to the date of the Charges, for 
Qui prior est tempore potior est jure. 

EE EICHAEDS, HUMBEE v. EICHAEDS. [1890] 
(59 L. J. Ch. 728 ; 45 Ch. D. 589 ; 63 L. T. 451 ; 39 W. E. 186.) 

W. A. Richards, a solicitor, in 1883 received money from a 
client for the purpose of investment, and represented to him 
that he had invested it upon the security of a particular mort- 
gage. The mortgage, however, was one which Richards had 
previously taken in his own name, and it was never afterwards 
transferred to the client. He afterwards deposited the title 
deeds of the mortgaged property with his bankers to secure his 
overdrawn account, and paid interest on the mortgage to the 
client down to the death of the latter in 1885, and subsequently 
to his executors. Richards died in 1888, his account being- 
overdrawn to an extent exceeding the value of the mortgaged 
property, and the bank immediately gave notice of their claim 
to the mortgagors. The bank had no notice of the client's 



220 EQUITY. 

claim at the date of the deposit, and their notice to the mort- 
gagors was prior to any notice given by the client's executors. 

Held, firsts that Richards ivas a trustee of the mortgage 
for his client^ and that neither the client nor his executors 
had been guilty of negligence so as to deprive them of their 
priority ; and secondly, that the principle of Dearie v. 
Hall (see p. 218) did not apply, and there/ore the bank 
were not entitled to priori/// by virtue of having given notice 
to the mortgagors before the executors. 



The Rule in Howe v. Dartmouth lays down that where by Will 
Personal Property of a Perishable Nature or not yielding 
a Present Income is given to be enjoyed in succession, the 
Property must be converted so as to give effect to the Will 
of the Testator. A slight indication of a contrary intention 
prevents the Rule applying. 

MORGAN v. MORGAN. [1852] 
(14 Beavan, 72.) 

A testator died bequeathing all his personal property to his 
wife for life and then to his children. Part of this property 
consisted of long annuities and leaseholds. 

Held) that they ought to be converted and the proceeds 
invested in Consols, of which the widow was to have the 
interest during her lifetime, for the rule in Howe v. 
Dartmouth (Earl of), 7 Ves. 137, applies in order to give 
effect to the wishes of the testator that the property shall be 
enjoyed in succession. 

Where, however, there is some indication that the property 
is to be enjoyed in specie this rule does not apply, and a 
slight indication of a contrary intention will prevent the 



EQUITABLE RIGHTS. 221 

rule applying. The mere absence of any direction to convert 
is not, however, sufficient. 



A Voluntary Settlement will be set aside under 13 Eliz. c. 5, at 
the suit of any subsequent Creditor, if at the time of its 
execution the Settlor was indebted, and the ultimate effect 
is to delay payment of his Debt to a Creditor, however solvent 
the Settlor may have been at the time, and however free from 
any fraudulent intention the Settlement may have been. 

FEEEMAN v. POPE. [1869] 
(39 L. J. Ch. 689 ; L. B. 5 Ch. 538 ; 21 L. T. 816 ; 18 W. E. 906.) 

A clergyman with an annual income of nearly 1,000/., made, 
in 1863, a voluntary settlement in favour of his god-daughter, 
and died in 1868 in insolvent circumstances, owing to his 
bankers the balance of a debt which had been contracted prior 
to the date of the settlement. A creditor, whose debt was con- 
tracted subsequently to the settlement, applied to set aside the 
settlement as fraudulent within 13 Eliz. c. 5. 

Held, the settlement must be set aside, although, having 
regard to the income and means of the settlor, the Court was 
of opinion that in executing the settlement he had no inten- 
tion whatever to cheat his creditors at that time. 

The result of the authorities, decided upon the statute 
13 Eliz. c. 5, is first, that where a debt contracted ante- 
cedently to the settlement exists, a subsequent creditor has 
the same rights as an antecedent creditor would have against 
the settlor ; and secondly, that whether or not the settlor 
had any intention to defraud his creditors, a creditor having 
a debt existing at the date of the settlement has a right to 
have the settlement set aside if the ultimate effect of it is to 
delay or defraud him with regard to his debt. 



222 EQUITY. 

A Family Composition will be Upheld though based on Error 
provided there is no Concealment of Material Information. 

GOEDON v. GOEDON. [1816] 
(3 Swanst. 400; 19 E E. 230.) 

A dispute arose between two brothers as to which of them 
was the heir of his father ; the younger son contended that his 
brother was born before their parents were married. An agree- 
ment was entered into for a division of the estates between the 
two, but before this agreement was entered into the younger 
brother found out that his brother was legitimate, as their 
parents had married by a private ceremony before the birth of 
the elder brother. He did not disclose this fact, and for nine- 
teen years enjoyed his share of the estate. The legitimacy of 
the elder having been established by a trial of the issue, the 
elder brother sought to set this agreement aside. 

Held, the agreement could not stand, for though a 
family agreement entered into by bona fide mistake is 
binding, even though it subsequently appears that neither 
party had a good title to the property in question, yet 
where either party has been misled by the concealment of 
material information, the Court trill not sanction the 
agreement. 



Time is not of the Essence of a Contract in the absence of express 
Stipulations between the Parties, or something in the nature 
of the Property or the surrounding circumstances which 
would render it inequitable for the Court to interfere with 
the Legal Right. 

TILLEY v. THOMAS. [1867] 
(L. E. 3 Ch. 61 ; 17 L. T. 422 ; 16 W. E. 166.) 

The plaintiff was the owner of certain premises at Fulham 
which he agreed to sell to the defendant for 700/., " possession 



EQUITABLE RIGHTS. 223 

to be given on the 14th of January next." The plaintiff knew 
that the defendant required immediate possession on that date 
for residential purposes, and as he had been unable to clear up 
his title, lie offered to give the defendant possession of the 
premises on that date. The defendant, however, refused to 
take possession, as he claimed to be entitled to possession under 
a good title, and not to actual possession only on the 14th 
January. The plaintiff subsequently produced a good title, and 
brought this action for specific performance. 

Held, the plaintiff was not entitled to specific perform- 
ance, as time was in this case, to the knowledge of both 
parties, of the essence of the contract. 

The words in the memorandum, " possession to be given 
on the Will of January next," meant possession with a 
good title. 

The Court will relieve against and enforce specific 
performance, notwithstanding a failure to keep the dates 
assigned by the contract, either for completion or for the 
steps towards completion, if it can do justice between the 
parties, and if there is nothing in the express stipulations 
between the parties, the nature of the property, or the 
surrounding circumstances which would make it inequitable 
to interfere with and modify the legal right. This is what 
is meant, and all that is meant, when it is said that in 
equity time is not of the essence of the contract. 



Where a Power is directed to be exercised by Deed, its exercise 
by Will is valid, but the converse does not prevail. 

BRUCE v. BRUCE. [1871] 
(40 L. J. Ch. 141 ; L. R. 11 Eq. 371 ; 24 L. T. 212.) 

The donee of a power to appoint by deed among the 
children of her first marriage, who were entitled to the estate in 



224 EQUITY. 

equal shares in default of appointment, executed deeds which 
she erroneously supposed to have extinguished that power and 
conferred upon her an unlimited testamentary power. By her 
will made during her second coverture, expressly in pursuance 
of the testamentary power and of every other power enabling 
her in that behalf, she appointed the estate to her eldest son, 
charged with a sum of 3,000/. for the benefit in equal shares of 
all her other children of both marriages. 

Held, that the will operated as an exercise of the power 
to appoint by deed among the children of the first marriage, 
and that the eldest son was entitled to the estate, subject to 
raising the sum of 3,000/. for the other two children of the 
first marriage. 

A will made by the donee of a special power to appoint 
by deed, though it shows that the donee supposed the 'power 
to have been extinguished and purports to be an execution 
of an invalid power and of all other powers enabling it in 
that behalf, and though it appoints to persons some of whom 
are strangers to the power, is a defective execution which 
Equity will aid in favour of a child otherwise provided for ', 
and to the prejudice of other children entitled in default of 
appointment. 

Note. — The exercise by deed of a power directed to be exercised 
by will is, however, invalid. Adney v. Field (1767), Amb. 654.

TRUSTS AND TRUSTEES. 



A purchase by a Trustee of Trust Property is bad, unless the 
Trustee can prove that the Parties to the Conveyance to him 
were at arms' length ; that the Cestuis que Trust had the 
fullest information on all material facts, and adopted the 
transaction. 

WILLIAMS v. SCOTT. [1900] 

(69 L. J. P. C. 77 ; (1900) A. C. 499 ; 82 L. T. 727 ; 49 W. R. 33.) 

The plaintiff claimed the return of the deposit paid by him to 
the defendant on a contract by the plaintiff to purchase and the 
defendant to sell certain land near Sydney, on the ground that 
the defendant could not give a good and sufficient title. The 
defendant claimed specific performance of the contract of sale. 

The plaintiff contended that the defendant's title was insuffi- 
cient by reason of the fact that he had purchased the land from 
a certain David Austin. 

David Austin was one of the trustees of a will which devised 
the land in question to the trustees in trust to sell the same. 
The trustees agreed to sell the land to S. J. Bull at a certain 
price, but this sale fell through ; and David Austin took the land 
over himself and accepted a conveyance, and then sold the land 
to the defendant. 

Held, by the Privy Council, that the plaintiff ivas entitled 
to a return of his deposit. 

A trustee for sale of trust property cannot sell to himself. 
If notwithstanding the form of the conveyance, the trustee 
[or any person claiming under him) seeks to justify the 
transaction as being really a purchase from the cestuis que 
trust, it is important to remember upon whom the onus of 
proof falls. It ought not to be assumed, in the absence of 

j. Q 



226 EQUITY. 

evidence to the contrary, that the transaction was a proper 
one, and that the cestuis que trust were informed of all 
necessary matters. The burthen of proof that the trans- 
action was a righteous one rests upon the trustee, ivho is bound 
to produce clear affirmative proof that the parties ivere at 
arms' length ; that the cestuis que trust had the fullest 
information upon all material facts ; and that having this 
information they agreed to and adopted what was done. 



A Trustee must not make a Profit : if he does, he must hold it on 
Trust for the Cestui que Trust. 

KEECH v. SANDFOBD. [1726] 
(Sel. Ca. Ch. 61.) 

The lease of a certain market being about to expire, the 
trustee of the infant lessee applied for a renewal of the lease, 
which was refused by the landlord on the ground that the 
infant could not make himself responsible on the covenants. 
Thereupon the trustee got the landlord to grant him a lease. 

Held, that the trustee was a constructive trustee of the 
lease for the infant and must assign the same to the infant, 
but was entitled to be indemnified from any covenants 
contained in the lease. 



A Trustee may only delegate in proper cases. A Trustee must 
exercise that ordinary care and diligence which a competent 
and prudent man of business would exercise in his own 
affairs. 
RE ue POTTIONIER, DENT v. de POTHONIEE. [1900] 
(69 L. J. Ch. 773 ; (1900) 2 Ch. 529 ; 83 L. T. 220.) 

This was a summons taken out by three of the trustees of the 
will of C. S. de Pothonier for directions as to what provisions 



TRUSTS AND TRUSTEES. 227 

should be made by the trustees for the custody or control of 
bonds and debentures payable to bearer, which they held upon 
the trusts of his will, and for the custody and collection of the 
coupons thereof. 

Held, per Cozens- Hardy, J., trustees entitled to hold, 
securities pat/able to bearer are entitled to leave such bonds 
in the custody of the bank at which they keep the trust 
account and alloiv the banker to cut off and collect the 
coupons as they fall due, as this is part of the business of a 
banker. It is not necessary in such a case to keep the 
bonds in a box tvith separate keys for each trustee. 

I think that the law does not impose upon trustees 
anything more than the exercise of that ordinary care and 
diligence which a competent and prudent man of business 
would exercise in his own affairs. 



A Trustee will not be allowed to hold Property conveyed to him 
as a Trustee as Beneficial Owner on the ground that there 
is no evidence of the Trust in writing as required by sect. 7 
of the Statute of Frauds, for the Court will not allow a 
Statute to be used as an Instrument of Fraud. 

KOCHEFOUCAULD (DUCHESSE DE) v. BOUSTEAD. 

[1897J 
(66 L. J. Ch. 74; (1897) 1 Ch. 196 ; 75 L. T. 502 ; 45 W. E. 272.) 

The plaintiff claimed a declaration against the defendant, 
John Boustead, a Ceylon merchant, that the purchase by him in 
1873 of certain coffee estates in Ceylon from the mortgagees 
thereof had been made by the defendant as trustee for the 
plaintiff, and she also asked for an account and payment of 
the balance found due. 

On May 27, 1873, the estates in question were, subject to two 
mortgages, sold and conveyed to the defendant. In form the 

q2 



228 EQUITY. 

conveyance was to him absolutely, but the estates were as a fact 
conveyed to the defendant as a trustee for the plaintiff, subject, 
however, to the repayment to the defendant of the amount 
which he paid for the estates and of the expenses which he had 
incurred in managing them. The estates were sold by the 
defendant or his mortgagees many years before without the 
knowledge of the plaintiff, who contended that the proceeds of 
the sale were more than sufficient to repay to the defendant all 
his advances, and that a considerable surplus remained, which 
the defendant ought to have paid over. 

The defendant relied, by way of defence, upon, inter alia, the 
Statute of Frauds and the plaintiff's laches. 

Held, the plaintiff' was entitled to what she claimed. 

It is a fraud on the part of a person to whom land is 
conveyed as a trustee, and who knows it to have been so 
conveyed, to deny the trust and claim the land. Conse- 
quently, notwithstanding the Statute of Frauds, it is 
competent for a person claiming land conveyed to another to 
prove by parol evidence that it was so conveyed on trust, 
and that the grantee, knowing the facts, is denying the trust, 
for it cannot now be questioned that the Statute of Frauds 
does not prevent the proof of a fraud. 

Where an express trust is established, mere lapse of time, 
if not coupled with other circumstances rendering it unjust 
to give relief, ivill not, apart from any Statute of Limita- 
tions, bar the claim of a cestui que trust. 



TRUSTS AND TRUSTEES. 229 

Where a Trustee is appointed by Will to distribute the Estate 
according to verbal directions, the Trust fails. 

RE HETLBY, HETLEY v. HETLEY. [1902] 
(71 L. J. Oh. 769; (1902) 2 Oh. 866; 87 L. T. 265 ; 51 W. R. 202.) 

A testator after appointing his wife sole executrix and giving 
her a life interest in his property, continued as follows : "I 
desire and empower her by her will or in her lifetime to dispose 
of my estate in accordance with my wishes verbally expressed 
by me to her." 

Held, that parol evidence was not admissible to explain 
the testator's wishes, and the clause purporting to create a 
power of disposition in the widow was void for uncertainty ', 
and the result was that the property was undisposed of and 
went as on an intestacy. 

By the Wills Act, 1837, no will can be valid unless it 
be in writing executed by the testator and attested as by the 
statute provided. To define or supplement by parol evidence 
that which on the face of the will is left undefined or 
unexpressed, ivould be to make a material addition to the 
written will, and is therefore not permissible. 



A Devisee or Legatee who is not named in the Will as a Trustee, 
and who accepts a particular Trust in the lifetime of the 
Testator, holds the Property on the Trust disclosed by the 
Testator. If the Trust is not disclosed by the Testator in his 
lifetime, but the Legatee or Devisee knows that he is to hold 
as Trustee, he holds as Trustee for the Next of Kin or Heir. 

IN RE BOYES, BOYES v. CARRITT. [1884] 
(53 L. J. Ch. 654 ; 26 Ch. D. 531 ; 50 L. T. 581 ; 32 W. R. 630.) 

The testator, by his will, made shortly before going abroad, 
gave all his property to Carritt, his sole executor, who was a 



230 EQUITY. 

solicitor and drew the will. In an action in the Probate 
Division, Carritt admitted that he was only a trustee of the 
property, and said that the intention of the testator was that he 
should hold it upon certain trusts of which he would inform 
him when hearrived abroad. No directions were given to Carritt 
by the testator during his lifetime, but after his death two 
letters were found among his papers addressed to Carritt and 
naming Mrs. Brown as the person whom he wished to be the 
object of his bounty. 

Held, that Carritt was a trustee for the next of km, and 
not for Airs. Brown, for a testator cannot, by imposing a 
trust on his devisee or legatee, the ohfect of which he does 
imt communicate to him, enable himself to evade the Statute 
of Wills by declaring those objects in an unattested paper 
found after his death. 

In order to make such a trust binding, it is essential that 
it should be communicated to the devisee or legatee during 
the testators lifetime, and that he should accept that 
particular trust. 



An Absolute Gift followed by an expression of Desire creates no 
Binding Trust. 

IN RE OLDFIELD, OLDFIELD v. OLDFIELD. [1904] 
(73 L. J. Ch. 433 ; (1904) 1 Ch. 549 ; 90 L. T. 392.) 

The testatrix, by will, gave her property equally between her 
two daughters for their own absolute use, and expressed her 
" desire " that each of them should, during the lifetime of her 
son, pay to him one-third of their respective incomes accruing 
from the moneys and investments under her will. 

Held, by the House of Lords, that the will created no 
trust enforceable by the son. 



TRUSTS AND TRUSTEES. 231 

11 Wherever any person gives property and points out the 
object of the property and the way in which it shall go ) that

A Voluntary Assignment must be made either by a Complete and 
Perfect Assignment or by a valid Declaration of Trust. 

RICHAEDS v. DELBE1DG-E. [1874] 
(43 L. J. Ch. 459 ; L. E. 18 Eq. 11 ; 22 W. E. 584.) 

A person entitled to a leasehold mill with plant, machinery, 
and stock-in-trade, endorsed on the lease a memorandum : 
" This deed, and all thereto belonging, I give to Edward 
Bennetts Richards from this time forth, with all the stock-in- 
trade," and he signed the memorandum and handed the deed 
to Richards' mother. After his death, Richards claimed the 
mill and appurtenances, on the ground that the memorandum 
amounted to a valid declaration of trust. 

Field, that Richards was not entitled to the property. 

A man may transfer his property tvithout value in two 
ways — either by a complete and perfect conveyance to a 
person beneficially or to someone in trust for that person ; 
or by a valid declaration of trust constitute himself a trustee 
for that person. 

In this case the conveyance tvas imperfect, and there was 
no declaration of trust , for words importing a present 
intention to give cannot be held to amount to an intention to 
retain as trustee. 



232 EQUITY. 

The positive duties of a Trustee are to properly preserve the Trust 
Fund, to pay the Income and the Corpus to those entitled, and 
to give all their Cestuis que Trust on demand information 
with respect to the mode in which the Trustees have dealt 
with the Fund. It is not part of their duty to answer 
inquiries made by Persons about to deal with their Cestuis 
que Trust. 

LOW v. BOUVERIE. [1891] 

(60 L. J. Ch. 594 ; (1891) 3 Ch. 82 ; 65 L. T. 533 ; 40 W. E. 50.) 

In answer to an inquiry addressed by an intending mort- 
gagee to the trustee of a fund whether the life-tenant had 
incumbered his interest, the trustee enumerated certain specific 
charges on the life interest. At this date the trustee had 
received notice of several other incumbrances, but he had for- 
gotten their existence. In an action to recover the loss arising 
from the insufficiency of the mortgage — 

Held, by the Court of Appeal, that the trustee was not 
liable in the absence of estoppel, and that his answer did not 
amount to a positive representation that there ivere no other 
incumbrances on the life interest, so as to create an estoppel 
against him. 

Per Lindley, L. J.: The positive duties of trustees arc 
to properly preserve the trust f mid, to pay the income and 
the corpus to those who are entitled to them respectively , 
and to give all their cestuis que trust on demand informa- 
tion ivith respect to the mode in which the trustees have 
dealt ivith the fund and ivhere it is. 

There is no duty upon the trustee to answer inquiries 
made by persons about to deal ivith their cestui que trust, 
and if a trustee gives an honest answer he discharges the 
only obligation which he is under. 



TRUSTS AND TRUSTEES. 233 

Where Money is received in a fiduciary capacity the Cestui que 
Trust is entitled, as long as it can be traced, to follow it and 
claim it against all the World. If Trust Money is paid into 
a Trustee's own Account, the Trustee is presumed to pay out 
his own Moneys first. 

IN EE HALLETT'S ESTATE, KNATCHBULL v. HALLETT. 

[1879] 

(49 L. J. Ch. 415 ; 13 Ch. D. 696 ; 42 L. T. 421 ; 

28 W. B. 732— C. A.) 

A trustee improperly sold Russian bonds and paid the pro- 
ceeds to the credit of his own account at his bank, mixing them 
with his own private moneys. After such payments in he paid 
in sums of his own and also drew out others by cheques for his 
own purposes. There was a balance standing to his credit at 
his death. 

Held, iv here a person occupying a fiduciary capacity pays 
trust money into his own account at the bank, the cestui que 
trust is entitled to follow the money into the banking 
account, and to have a charge on the balance in the banker 's 
hands, for the rule in Clayton's Case, 1 Mer. 572, attri- 
buting the first drawings out to the first payments in, does 
not apply as between trustee and cestui que trust, and the 
trustee must be taken to have drawn out his own money, 
and not the trust money. 



A Trustee may rely on the Statutes of Limitation in an Action 
for Breach of Trust unless " party or privy " to the Fraud, 
or the Property or its Proceeds are still retained by him. 

THOENE v. HEAED AND MAESH. [1895] 

(64 L. J. Ch. 652 ; (1895) A. C. 495 ; 11 E. 254 ; 73 L. T. 291 ; 

44 W. E. 155— H. L.) 

In 1878 first mortgagees under their power of sale sold the 
mortgaged property and received the amount due to them from 



234 EQUITY. 

their solicitor, who was also a solicitor tor a second mortgagee 
and for the mortgagor. They handed over the balance of the 
purchase- money to the solicitor, who gave them a receipt 
acknowledging payment of the moneys due to the second 
mortgagee. But he retained the whole balance for his own 
use, did not inform the second mortgagee of the sale, and 
continued to pay interest on the second mortgage until, in 
1892, he became bankrupt, when his fraud was discovered. 

Held, by the House of Lords, the first mortgagees were 
entitled to the benefit of the Statute of Limitations under 
the Trustee Act, 1888; that they were not u party or 
privy'''' to the fraud of the solicitor ; that the moneys were 
not u still retained " by them within sect. 8 of that Act; 
and that the statute began to run in their favour from the 
(late of the transaction in 1878, and not from the discovery 
of the fraud in 1892. 

By the Lord Chancellor [Lord Herschell) and Lord 
Davey. — It is open to question ivhether, even apart from 
the statute of 1888, the defendants would have been liable 
in the circumstances of the case. 



Where a Transfer of Property is made by one Person into the 
name of another, who gives no value, and to whom he is not 
in loco parentis, there is prima facie a Resulting Trust for the 
Transferor. But this Presumption may be rebutted by 
showing that a Benefit was intended. 

STANDING v. BOWKING. [1886] 

:&gt;:&gt; L. J. Oh. 218 ; 31 Oh. D. 282 ; 54 L. T. 191 ; 34 W. E. 

204— C. A.) 

Mrs. Standing transferred stock standing in her own name in 
the books of the bank into the joint names of herself and Bow- 
ling, her godson, who was entirely ignorant of the transfer, 



TRUSTS AND TRUSTEES. 235 

with the settled intention of conferring a benefit on Bowring 
after her own death. 

Mrs. Standing brought this action seeking a declaration that 
Bowring held the stock as trustee for her, and to compel him to 
re-transfer it into her sole name. 

Held, that the rule is well settled that, in the case of a 
transfer into the names of the transferor and a person not 
his son or adopted son, there is prima facie a resulting 
trust for the transferor. But the presumption is capable 
of being rebutted by showing that a benefit was intended. 
In this case, Mrs. Standing having transferred the stock 
with the deliberate intention of benefitting Bowring, and as 
no such trust as was now sought to be declared could be 
implied, the gift to Bowring was complete, and the legal 
title vested in him notwithstanding that he was ignorant of, 
and consequently had not assented to, the transfer. 

When a transfer is made to a person, even though 
accompanied by onerous obligations, the property vests in 
kirn subject to his right of repudiation on becoming cognisant 
of the transfer. 



CHARITABLE TRUSTS. 



Charitable Gifts will be applied cy pres where it is no longer 
possible to beneficially apply Property in the same way as 
directed by the Founder of the Charity. 

IN EE THE CAMPDEN CHAEITIES. [1880] 
(50 L. J. Ch. 646 ; 18 Ch. D. 310 ; 45 L. T. 152 ; 30 W. E. 496.) 

In the first half of the seventeeth century, substantial sums 
of money were left by Lord and Lady Campden, the income of 



2S6 EQUITY. 

which was to be spent in pensions to the deserving poor and in 
apprenticing poor boys in the parish of Kensington. 

At the time these proceedings were brought the income of the 
charities exceeded 3,500/., but there was in the parish of Ken- 
sington no lack of deserving recipients of the charities as thus 
administered. 

In 1879 the Charity Commissioners made an order confirming 
a new scheme for the administration of the charities, under 
which one moiety of the entire income was in effect devoted to 
the advancement of the education of the children resident in 
Kensington attending public elementary schools. 

This scheme was objected to by the trustees on various 
grounds, and on petition to the Court to set aside or vary the 
scheme — 

Held, by the Court of Appeal) that the scheme had been 
properly made in pursuance of what is commonly known as 
the cy pres doctrine) -which is applied in cases like this, where 
from lapse of time and change of circumstances it is no 
longer possible beneficially to apply the property left by the 
founder or donor in the exact way in ivhich he has directed 
it to be applied) but it can only be applied beneficially to 
similar purposes by different means. 

When a scheme has been settled by the Charity Cornmis- 
sio?ierS) the Court will not interfere unless the Commissioners 
have exceeded their jurisdiction or have made .some slip or 
gross miscarriage which calls for the intervention of the 

Court. 



CONVERSION. 237 

The Rule against Perpetuities does not apply to Property given 

to Charities. 

IN EE TYLEE, TYLEE v. TYLEE. [1891] 
(60 L. J. Ch. 686; (1891) 3 Ch. 252 ; 65 L. T. 367 ; 40 W. E. 7— 

C. A.) 

Sir James Tyler made a bequest to a charitable institution — 
the London Missionary Society — subject to a condition that 
they should keep the testator's tomb in repair, with a gift over 
to another charitable institution on failure to comply with the 
condition. 

An originating summons was taken out to ascertain whether 
the condition attached to the legacy to the London Missionary 
Society was binding on the trustees of that society or was 
void. 

Held, that the condition as to the repair was valid and 
binding on the trustees, and that the gift over to another 
charity on failure to comply with the condition was good, 
as the rule against perpetuities had no application to 
charities. 



CONVERSION. 

Where a man seised of real estate contracts to sell it and dies 
before the Contract is carried into execution, it is, as between 
his Heir and Next of Kin, deemed to have been converted, 
from the Date of the formation of the Contract, into Per- 
sonalty. 

IN EE ISAACS, ISAACS v. EEGINALL. [1894] 

(63 L. J. Ch. 815 ; f 1894) 3 Ch. 506 ; 8 E. 660 ; 71 L. T. 386 ; 

42 W. E. 685.) 

Isaacs died intestate, having granted certain freehold here- 
ditaments to T. A. Cadle on lease for the grantor's life, with an 



238 EQUITY. 

option to Cadle of purchasing the property at a given price, 
such option to be declared by Cadle within six calendar months 
from the time of the grantor's death. Cadle duly exercised the 
option. 

Held, following Laws v. Bennett, 1 Cox, 167, that the 
conversion as between the heir and next of kin took place 
from the date of the contract giving the option, and therefore 
the purchase-money went to the testator's legal personal 
representative, and not to his heir-at-law. 



ELECTION. 



If a Person whose Property another Person affects to give away 
takes other Benefits under the same Instrument, and at the 
same time elects to keep his own Property, he must make 
Compensation to the Person affected by his election to an 
extent not exceeding the Benefits he receives. 

IN EE BOOTH, BOOTH v. EOBINSON. [1906] 
(75 L. J. Ch. 610 ; (1906) 2 Ch. 321 ; 95 L. T. 524.) 

The testator was absolutely entitled to some copyhold pro- 
perty, and had a life interest in some settled property over 
which he had no power of disposition, but which went on his 
death to all his children who, having reached twenty-one years, 
survived him. 

The testator, by will, purported to dispose of both properties 
partly to his children and partly to others, so that some of those 
who were benefited under the settlement also took other benefits 
under the will. They all elected to take against the will. This 
election deprived some of the electing parties of shares in the 
settled property given to them by the will. 



ELECTION. 239 

Held, that the persons electing to take against the ivill 
ivere respectively bound to make compensation to other per- 
sons so electing, as well as to persons who took under the 
will , only for an y disappointment occasioned by the election, 
to the extent of the benefits received under the will by the 
several persons electing to take against it. 

The true principle of compensation in these cases is stated 
by Jessel, M. R., in Rogers v. Jones (1876), 3 Ch. D. 
688, 689, in the following words: "If a person whose 
property a testator affects to give away takes other benefits 
under the same will, and at the same time elects to keep his 
own property, he must make compensation to the person 
affected by his election to an extent not exceeding the benefits 
he receives." In other words, so far as he receives benefits 
under the ivill, he must give effect to the testator 's intention, 
and compensate the persons whom he disappoints to the 
extent of the benefits which he receives under the ivill, 
including any compensation made to him by another legatee 
by iv horn he is himself disappointed. 



The doctrine of Election depends on Intention, and where Settlor 
settles Property on a Woman without Power of Anticipation 
this is a declaration of Intention inconsistent with and 
excluding the doctrine of Election. 

IN EE VARDON'S TRUSTS. [1885] 
(55 L. J. Ch. 259 ; 31 Ch. D. 275 ; 53 L. T. 895 ; 34 W. R. 185.) 

In 1860, a marriage being in contemplation between Mr. 
Walker and Miss Yardon, then an iufant, a settlement was 
executed whereby 5,000/. was settled upon the wife for her life 
for her separate use with a restraint on anticipation. The 
settlement contained a covenant by each of them to settle any 



240 EQUITY. 

after-acquired property upon trust for the husband for life with 
remainder to the wife in default of children. In 1883, under a 
bequest to Mrs. Walker contained in the will of her deceased 
brother, she became entitled to 8,573/. for her separate use, and 
the question arose whether she was entitled to take this legacy 
without compensating, out of the 5,000/., the persons who were 
disappointed by her not settling the 8,573/. 

Held, the wife was not bound to elect, for the doctrine of 
election depends on intention, and a settlement which settles 
property on the ivife without potver of anticipation, contains 
a declaration of a particular intention inconsistent with and 
excluding the doctrine of election ; so that the married 
woman who by the settlement has [being an infant) cove- 
nanted to settle future property is not bound, on taking a 
bequest for her separate use, /■&gt; make compensation to her 
husband and children out of the income of the fund settled 
to her separate use without power of anticipation. 



ADEMPTION AND SATISFACTION. 



If a Legacy is bequeathed to a Person for a particular purpose, 
and a subsequent Gift is made for the same purpose, there is 
prima facie Presumption of Ademption or Satisfaction of the 
Legacy. 

IN EE POLLOCK, POLLOCK v. WORRAL. [1884] 
(54 L. J. Ch. 489 ; 28 Ch. D. 552 ; 52 L. T. 718— C. A.) 

The testatrix by her will dated the 24th of October, 1874, 
bequeathed to her niece 500/., "according to the wish of my 
late beloved husband." 

In July, 1881, she sold out some stock to which she was 



ADEMPTION AND SATISFACTION. 241 

entitled, and out of the proceeds thereof paid to her niece the 
sum of 300/., making contemporaneous entries relative to such 
payment in a diary which she kept, in one of which it was 
described as "the legacy," and in another as " being a legacy 
from her Uncle John." 

Held, the legacy was adeemed or satisfied pro tanto by 
the gift of 300/. 

Numerous authorities have determined that if a legacy 
appears on the face of the will to be bequeathed for a 
particular purpose, and a subsequent gift appears by 
proper evidence to have been made for the same purpose, 
a prima facie presumption is raised in favour of 
ademption. 



Equity leans against Double Portions, but Substantial Differences 
between the two will rebut the presumption of Satisfaction. 

TUSSATJD v. TUSSAUD. [1878] 
(47 L. J. Ch. 849 ; 9 Ch. D. 363 ; 39 L. T. 113; 26 W. E. 874.) 

In 1867 Tussaud, on the marriage of his daughter to Mr. 
White, covenanted with the trustees of her settlement that, if 
he should predecease his wife, his executors would, within 
six months after her death, transfer to the trustees of the settle- 
ment 2,000/. Consols, to be held upon trust for such persons as 
the daughter should, with consent of the trustees, by deed or 
will appoint ; and in default of appointment upon trust for the 
daughter for life, then for the husband for life, then for the 
children of the marriage ; and then, in default of children, for 
the husband absolutely. 

Tussaud, by his will made in 1874, bequeathed 2,800/. upon 
trust for his daughter for life for her separate use without 
power of anticipation, and after her death for her children by 
any marriage ; and in default of children the fund fell into the 



242 EQUITY. 

residue of Tussaud's estate, and went to liis sons. Tussaud 
•lied in 1874 and his wife in 1877. 

Held, by the Court of Appeal, that there were such 
substantial differences betiveen the provisions of the settle- 
ment and of the will that the presumption against double 
portions ivas rebutted. 

It is tvell established that there is a presumption against 
double portions founded on the assumption that, in making 
the second instrument, the maker of it supposes himself to be 
substantially satisfying the obligations of the first. But this 
presumption must yield to any sufficient indication of inten- 
tion on the part of the maker of the instrument, whether 
expressed on the face of the document or proved by parol 
evidence. 



EQUITABLE LIEN. 



Where a Debtor is entitled to Indemnity, his Creditor is entitled 
by the Doctrine of Subrogation to stand in his shoes and avail 
himself of that Indemnity. 

IN EE FEITH, NEWTON v. EOLFE. [1902] 
(71 L. J. Oh. 199 ; (1902) 1 Ch. 342 ; 86 L. T. 212.) 

Certain trustees under powers contained in the will carried on 
the testator's business after his death and employed his estate 
therein, and one of them made default for which he alone was 
liable. 

Held, the creditors of the business will not, on account of 
such default, be precluded from their right to rank against 
the testator's estate by subrogation to the right of the 
innocent trustees to be indemnified in respect of debts 
properly incurred by the trustees in carrying on the business. 



MARRIED WOMEN'S PROPERTY. 243 



MARRIED WOMEN'S PROPERTY. 



Where a Married Woman possessed of Property subject to Restraint 
on Anticipation becomes Bankrupt, the Property vests in her 
Trustee subject to the Restraint during the lifetime of her 
Husband, and free from Restraint on his Death. 

EE WHEELEE'S SETTLEMENT, BEIGGS v. EYAN. [1899] 

(68 L. J. Ch. 663; (1899) 2 Ch. 717; 81 L. T. 172; 
48 W. E. 10; 6 Mansou, 372.) 

In 1859 certain real property was vested in a trustee upon 
trust during the life of Caroline Wheeler to pay her the rents 
and profits for her sole and separate use, but without power to 
her, whilst covert or sole, to charge or anticipate the same. 
Caroline Wheeler married Albert Byan in 1868. In 1891 she 
was carrying on business as a schoolmistress apart from her 
husband, and in June, 1891, she was adjudicated a bankrupt. 
In February, 1899, her husband died, she being then still an 
undischarged bankrupt. 

Held, that the entire life estate of Mrs. Ryan was her 
separate estate at the date of the bankruptcy within the 
meaning of sect. 1, sub-sect. 5, of the Married Women's 
Property Act, 1882, and that the restraint upon anticipa- 
tion attached only during her married life, and that the 
residue of the life interest from the death of her husband 
belonged to the trustee in bankruptcy, and must be applied 
in satisfaction of Mrs. Ryan's debts.

244 EQUITY. 



RESCISSION. 

Damages in addition to Rescission will not be given for Breach of 

Contract. 

HENTY v. SCHEODEE. [1879] 
(48 L. J. Ch. 792 ; 12 Ch. D. 666; 27 W. E, 833.) 

The plaintiff obtained judgment for specific performance of a 
contract for the purchase by the defendant of certain real 
estate, and after tender of the conveyance of the property to the 
defendant found the defendant was unable to pay the sum due. 

The plaintiff then applied for rescission of the agreement and 
damages for the breach of contract, and filed an affidavit to the 
effect that he did not believe the defendant then was or would 
at any future time be able to pay the sum due for the purchase 
and costs. 

Held, per Jessel, M. /?., the Court cannot rescind an 
agreement and at the same time give damages for its breach. 
The only order he could make would he to direct the contract 
to be rescinded and the defendant to pay the costs of the 
action. 

SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. 



Specific Performance of a Contract will not be granted where the 
conduct of the Plaintiff disentitles him to the Relief in Equity, 
or where hardship would be done to some Innocent Lessor or 
Grantor by reason of some mistake which he has made. 

HEXTEE v. PEAECE. [1900] 
(69 L. J. Ch. 146; (1900) 1 Ch. 341; 82 L. T. 109; 48 W. E. 330.) 

The defendant, an owner in common of an undivided moiety 
of freehold lands, agreed to grant the plaintiff a lease to work 



SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE 245 

the minerals in or upon such moiety from the 29th September, 
1898, for five years. 

The defendant and his co-owner in common of the land sub- 
sequently granted a certain Mr. Wilkinson a lease of the whole 
property from the same date and for the same purpose. 

The defendant refused to grant the lease to the plaintiff, who 
accordingly brought this action for specific performance. 

At the trial it was proved there was still a considerable 
quantity of clay left, and that in previous years the land had 
been worked simultaneously by different persons. 

Held, by Farwell, J., the plaintiff was entitled to 
specific performance. 

The whole doctrine of specific performance rests on the 
ground that a man is entitled in equity to have in specie 
the specific article Jor which he has contracted, and he is 
not bound to take damages instead. The Court will grant 
the equitable remedy in all cases unless there has been 
some conduct on the part of the plaintiff disentitling him 
to the relief in equity, or in some rare instances unless 
there would he a, great hardship imposed on an innocent 
grantor or lessor by reason of some mistake which he has 
made, although the other party has not contributed to it. 



INJUNCTIONS. 



Where Damages are inadequate the Court will grant an Injunction 
to restrain a serious Nuisance except under very exceptional 
circumstances. 

SHELFEE v. THE CITY OF LONDON ELECTEIC 

LIGHTING CO., LIMITED [1895] 

(64 L. J. Ch. 216; (1895) 1 Oh. 287; 12 E. 112; 72 L. T. 34 ; 

43 W. E. 238— C. A.) 

The defendants were carrying on their work under certain 
provisional orders granted by the Board of Trade under the 



246 EQUITY. 

Electric Lighting Acts, 1882 and 1888, and confirmed by 
special Acts of Parliament. Under the several orders they 
were, subject to the provisions of the orders and the principal 
Act, empowered to supply energy within certain areas and for 
that purpose to execute certain works within such areas, and 
were to furnish energy to owners and occupiers of premises 
within the areas upon being required so to do. They might 
also acquire land to a limited extent for the purposes of the 
orders. The orders provided that nothing therein should 
exonerate the undertakers from any proceedings for nuisance 
in the event of a nuisance being caused by them. 

The defendants had under these powers acquired land and 
erected buildings and machinery for the supply of electricity. 
The working of their engines had caused vibration and noise, 
which had interfered with the comfort of the occupation of a 
neighbouring house to the extent of making the occupier's wife 
and daughter ill. It had also so shaken the walls of the house 
as to cause cracks in them and a settlement of the house. 
There was evidence that the defendants intended to erect more 
powerful engines. In an action by the tenant and reversioners 
of the house — 

Held, the tenant was entitled to an injunction to protect 
him from the nuisance diwing his tenancy ; and the nuisance 
being of such a permanent character as to cause injury to 
the reversion, the reversioners were entitled to an injunction 
also. 

iSect. 2 of Lord Cairns' Act, gave to Courts of equity 
jurisdiction to award damages, which they had not before ; 
but it did not interfere with the princij)les upon which those 
Courts had acted as regards granting injunctions up to that 
lime. Accordingly, where a plaintiff has established a legal 
right and its infringement already, and threatened further 
infringement, he is entitled to an injunction according to the 
ordinary 'principles on ivhich the Court acts in such cases. 



INJUNCTIONS. 247 

The Court will not alloiv a wrong to continue simply because 
the wrongdoer — whether a private individual or a corpora- 
tion acting in some sense for the benefit of the public — is 
able and willing to pay for the injury inflicted. 

Per Smith, L. J. : In my opinion, it may be stated as 
a good working rule that first, if the injury to the plain- 
tiff's legal right is small; and secondly, is one which is 
capable of being estimated in money ; and thirdly, is one 
which can be adequately compensated by a small money 
payment ; and fourthly, the case is one in which it would 
be oppressive to the defendant to grant an injunction, 
damages in lieu of an injunction may be awarded. If these 
Jour requirements are found in combination in a case, then 
damages in substitution for an injunction may be given. 



Although there is no Property in a Name, an Injunction will be 
granted where the Name of a New Business so nearly re- 
sembles that of a previously existing Business as to be likely 
to Deceive. 

TUSSAUD v. TUSSAUD. [1890] 
(59 L. J. Ch. 631 ; 44 Gh. D. 678 ; 62 L. T. 633 ; 38 W. E. 503 ; 

2 Meg. 120.) 

The plaintiffs were a registered company carrying on the 
business of a wax-work exhibition in London under the name 
of " Madame Tussaud and Sons, Limited." Their exhibition 
was a very old-established one. The defendant, Louis Tussaud, 
was a wax-modeller, who had formerly been employed by the 
plaintiff company, but had never carried on any business on 
his own account. He promoted a company, of which he was to 
be manager, to carry on an exhibition similar to that of the 
plaintiffs, but in another part of London. It was proposed to 



2 18 EQUITY. 

register the new company under the name of " Louis Tussaud, 
Limited." The plaintiffs moved for an injunction to restrain 
the defendant from proceeding with the registration of the new 
company under the proposed name or any other name so nearly 
resembling that of the plaintiff as to be calculated to deceive. 

Held, that the plaintiffs were entitled to an injunction. 



The Vendor of the Goodwill of a Business may not canvass his 
former Customers. The same applies to a retiring Partner, 
who has no share in the Goodwill. An Injunction will be 
granted to prevent such Canvassing. 

TREGO v. HUNT. [1896] 

(65 L. J. Ch. 1 ; (1896) A. C. 7 ; 73 L. T. 514 ; 
44 W. R. 225— H. L. (E.).) 

The plaintiff and defendant entered into an agreement of 
partnership to carry on the business of varnish and japan 
manufacturers under the style of Tabor, Trego &amp; Co., for a 
term of seven years. The agreement provided that the goodwill 
should nevertheless be and remain the sole property of Trego. 

Just before the termination of the partnership, the plaintiff 
found that the defendant had employed a clerk of the firm out 
of office hours to copy for him the names, addresses and 
businesses of all the firm's customers, his object admittedly 
being to acquire information which would enable him, when the 
partnership came to an end, to canvass these persons and to 
endeavour to obtain their custom for himself. 

The plaintiff moved for an injunction to. restrain the 
defendant. 

//'A/, the plaintiff was entitled /&lt;&gt; an injunction. 
Neither the vendor of the goodwill of a business nor the 
retiring partner^ who has !/•&gt; share in the goodwill of the 
business, is entitled to solicit the old customers of the 
business. 



ACCOUNTS. 249 



ACCOUNTS. 



Settled Accounts will only be opened by the Court on the ground 
of Fraud. Where there is no Fraud, and the Settled Accounts 
are of some years' standing 1 , the Court will only give liberty 
to surcharge and falsify. 

GETHING v. KEIGHLEY. [1878] 
(48 L J. Ch. 45 ; 9 Oh. D. 547 ; 27 W. E. 283.) 

The plaintiff and defendant had been in partnership together 
as solicitors for some twenty years A general balance sheet 
which was signed by both the parties had been made up by the 
defendant some years before and had long been treated as settled. 

A considerable error having been found in the account, the 
plaintiff claimed that he was entitled to reopen the account. 

Held, per Jessel, M. R., the plaintiff is not entitled to 
open the settled account, but the ordinary partnership 
accounts must be taken, and the plaintiff may have leave 
to surcharge and falsify the balance sheet. 

In seeking to open settled accounts, the Court acts on 
the following principle : — 

Where a single item complained of is a fraudulent 
item, the proper order to make is to open the accounts 
altogether ; where the item complained of is not fraudulent, 
and the accounts are of some years' standing, the proper 
order to make is to give liberty to surcharge and falsify. 

Where there is a question of surcharging and falsifying 
settled accounts, the case alleged must be clearly proved, 
by the person impeaching them, and if there is any doubt 
it will be determined against him. 



250 EQUITY. 

RECE1 VERS. 



A Receiver and Manager appointed by the Court is an Officer of 
the Court, and an interference with him in the discharge of 
his duties constitutes a Contempt of Court, punishable by 
Imprisonment. 

HELMOEE v. SMITH. [1886] 
(56 L. J. Ch. 145 ; 35 Ch. D. 449 ; 56 L. T. 72 ; 35 W. R. 157— C. A.) 

In a partnership action, the Court ordered a dissolution and 
the usual accounts to be taken, and appointed the defendant 
interim receiver and manager. On the next day, H. W. 
Helmore, a son of the plaintiff, who had taken an active part in 
the dispute between the plaintiff and defendant, sent a circular 
to all the customers of the firm which would lead the customers 
to infer that the business was in a failing state or would fail 
shortly. 

Held, this was a libel on the business, and an inter- 
ference with the receiver and manager in the discharge of 
his duties, and is a contempt of Court which the Court 
will punish hj sending the sender of the circular to prison. 



The Court has Jurisdiction to appoint a Receiver and Manager of 
a Partnership Business to preserve the Assets and to sell it 
as a Going Concern. 

TAYLOR v. NEATE. [1888] 
(57 L. J. Ch. 1044 ; 39 Ch. D. 538 ; 60 L. T. 179; 37 W. R. 190.) 

By a partnership deed made in May, 1883, the plaintiff and 
defendant agreed to carry on, in partnership, a business of 
mechanical engineers and contractors from that time until Sep- 
tember, L902, with power to determine same on the 30th of 
June, 1888, at the option of either party upon notice. 



RECEIVERS. 251 

On the 13th of July, 1888, the plaintiff commenced the 
present action to have the partnership wound up, and for the 
appointment of a receiver and manager. 

It was agreed during the hearing that there should be judg- 
ment for dissolution and for the sale of the business as a going- 
concern or otherwise. 

Heavy contracts were outstanding which would take several 
months to complete, and the defendant resisted the present 
motion, for the appointment of a receiver and manager to carry 
on the business, on the ground that the Court by appointing a 
receiver and manager to carry on the business would be in effect 
making an order for the continuation of the business although 
the partnership had been dissolved by express agreement 
between the parties. 

Held, the Court has jurisdiction to appoint a receiver 
and manager of a partnership business, with a view to 
selling the business as a going concern, notwithstanding 
that the partnership has expired in pursuance of pro- 
visions to that effect contained in the partnership detd. 



ADMINISTRATION OF ASSETS. 



An Executor de son Tort is subject to all the Liabilities but has 
none of the Privileges of an Ordinary Executor. 

CARMICHAEL v. CAEMICHAEL. [184b] 
(2 Phil. 101 ; 10 Jur. 908.) 

On the death of the testator, the executors all having re- 
nounced probate, his widow took out letters of administration 
with the will annexed. At the time of the death of the testator 
his son was in Demerara, and before letters of administration 
had been granted to the widow, and without authority, he 
collected the testator's effects in that colony and paid all his 



252 EQUITY. 

debts. The son, who was sued as executor de son tort, together 
with his mother as administratrix, pleaded that before the action 
was brought he had accounted to his mother for his receipts and 
expenditure and paid the balance due. 

Held, that such a settled or stated account was not 
binding on the plaintiff, and the Court would not insert 
in the decree the usual order that settled or stated accounts 
were not to be disturbed. 

An executor de son tort is subject to &gt;tll the liabilities, 
but has unite of th" privileges of an ordinary executor. 



The Personal Estate of a Testator is primarily liable to the pay- 
ment of his Debts and Funeral and Testamentary Expenses, 
unless exonerated expressly or by implication. 

TEOTT v. BUCHANAN. [1885] 
(54 L. J. Ch. 678 ; 28 Ch. D. 446 ; 52 L. T. 248 ; 33 W. E. 339.) 

A testator, hy deed, conveyed and assigned certain real and 
personal estate to trustees in trust for himself for life, and after 
his death upon trust to sell and convert and stand possessed of 
the net proceeds on trust to pay all the debts which should be 
due from him, and after such payments as aforesaid, on trust 
for his two sons. 

The testator, by his will, after reciting the deed, devised and 
bequeathed all the residue of his real and personal estate not 
comprised in and subject to the trusts of the deed to his wife 
for life with remainders over. 

Held, first, that the personal estate comprised in the 
deed was the primary fund for payment of debts ; second///, 
that the general personal estate must then be resorted to, 
and then the realty comprised in the deed; and finally, the 
residuary realty under the will. 



PROBATE. 253 



PROBATE. 



An Oral Declaration by a Soldier on Active Service will constitute 

a Valid Will. 

IN EE SCOTT. [1903] 
(73 L. J. P. 17 ; (1903) P. 243 ; 89 L. T. 588.) 

The deceased, who served as a volunteer in the South African 
War, died in South Africa on March 3, 1902, of wounds 
received in action. 

The commanding officer had directed squadron officers to 
submit rolls to orderly room showing the next of kin of all men 
under their command, or the person they desired their effects 
should go to in case of death. In accordance with these in- 
structions the deceased made an oral declaration to two non-com- 
missioned officers to the following effect : — 

" In the event of my death in South Africa, I desire all my 
effects to be credited to my sister, Miss N. Scott, 39, Hanley 
Road, London, N." 

Held, by the President of the Probate Division (Sir F. H. 
Jeune), the declaration having been made on active service, 
may be admitted to probate as a soldier's will. 



Intention to revoke Will has no effect unless Will actually 
destroyed or otherwise formally revoked. 

IN RE HARRIS, CHEESE v. LOVEJOY. [1877] 
(46 L. J. P. 66 ; 2 P. D. 251 ; 37 L. T. 294 ; 25 W. R. 853— C. A.) 

The testator made a will and codicil, each bearing date the 
3rd day of July, 1852, and a second and third codicil each bearing 



254 PROBATE. 

dale the 'J 1st day of September, 1852, and appointed as his 
executor a person who predeceased him, and the plaintiff, under 
certain contingencies which happened, became a beneficial legatee. 
Previous to his death, the testator made several alterations and 
obliterations in his will which were not formally attested by the 
witnesses to the will, and left the will about, treating it as waste 
paper, but did not destroy it. 

Held, that the plaintiff was entitled to probate of the will 
in solemn form, excluding all the alterations and interlinea- 
tions. 

The tvords of the Wills Act, 1837, s. 21, " otherwise 
destroying" must be construed as intending some mode of 
destruction ejusdein generis with the preceding tvords, not 
an act which is not a destroying in the primary sense of the 
ivord. 

Striking through words tvith a pen, unless initialled as 
required by sect. 21 of the Wills Act, 1837, is not valid, 
and the ivill stands as though the alterations had not been 
made. 



A Testator may revoke a Will conditionally, in which case the 
Will is not revoked till the condition is fulfilled. 

DIXON v. SOLICITOR TO THE TREASURY. [1905 J 
(74 L. J. P. 33 ; (1905) P. 42 ; 92 L. T. 427 ; 21 T. L. R. 145.) 

The deceased shortly before his death sent for a solicitor, to 
whom he proceeded to give instructions for a new will, and 
having sent for the existing will there and then cut off the 
signature of the same. On the solicitor objecting the deceased 
replied " I meant to " (cancel this document) " because I am 
going to make a new will." And the deceased further made 
use of expressions to the effect that the cutting out of the 
signature was a necessary preliminary to a new will. Having 
cancelled his existing will, the deceased gave as a reason for 



PROBATE. 255 

making a new will his desire to increase a certain legacy. The 
solicitor having then taken instructions in respect to this legacy 
and other matters, used the existing document as a basis for 
instructions, saw the deceased on the next day, went through 
the instructions with him, and the new will would in the 
ordinary course have then been executed. The deceased, 
however, expressed a desire to have a draft prepared in the first 
instance. This was accordingly done, but on the third day, 
before it could be submitted, the deceased died. 

The jury found that the deceased mutilated his will with the 
intention of revoking it conditionally on a new one being 
executed. 

Held, per Gorell Barnes, J., in the circumstances the old 
will stands. 

In order to apply the doctrine of dependent relative revo- 
cation, it is not necessary that at the time of the actual 
revocation there should be in existence an earlier valid docu- 
ment which the testator intends to revive. The doctrine may 
extend to cases where there is an intention not in fact ful- 
filled to execute afresh testamentary paper. The question 
of intention is one of fact, to be determined on the circum- 
stances of each individual case. 



The Intestates' Estates Act, 1890, does not apply to cases of Partial 
Intestacy so as to enable the Widow to claim £500 as her 
provision in addition to her Distributive Share of the Residue. 

IN EE TWIGG'S ESTATE, TWIGG v. BLACK. [1892] 
(61 L. J. Ch. 444 ; (1892) 1 Ch. 579 ; 66 L. T. 604 ; 40 W. E. 297.) 

A testator died in November, 1890, leaving a widow and no 
issue. He stated in his will, that his widow was amply provided 
for by settlement, and made no further provision for her. The 



256 PROBATE. 

residuary legatees under the will died before the testator, so 
that there was a partial intestacy. The gross value of the 
testator's estate was sworn under 5,038/. 2h. 5d., and the net 
residue was over 50 &lt;)l. 

The widow having died in March, 1891, her legal representa- 
tives now claimed the sum of 500/. as the widow's provision 
under sects. 2 and 4 of the Intestates Act, 1890, in addition to 
her distributive share of the residue remaining after payment of 
such provision. 

Held, the Intestates Act, 1890, does not apply to cases 
of partial in testae//. 



Where there is a Gift of Property to a Husband and Wife and a 
Third Party in equal parts, the Husband and Wife only take 
half the Property between them. 

IN RE JUPP, JUPP v. BUCK WELL. [1888] 
(57 L. J. Ch. 774 ; 39 Ch. D. 148 ; 59 L. T. 129 ; 36 W. R. 712.) 

The testator by will made in 1887, directed a share of residue 
to be divided between " my sister Mary Buckwell, Daniel 
Buckwell her husband, and Harriett Buckwell her step-daughter 
in equal parts." 

Held, that independently of the Married Women's Pro- 
perty Act, 1882, the husband and wife would have taken 
only one share between them ; that this rule based on the 
unity of persons was not affected by that Act ; and that 
Mary Buckwell and Daniel Buckwell each took a quarter 
share and Harriett Buckivell a half share, the quarter share 
of Mary Buckwell being her separate property. 



PROBATE. 257 

A Legacy payable or to be paid at the age of twenty-one vests at 
death of Testator. A Legacy bequeathed to a person at 
twenty-one, or if or when he shall attain the age of twenty- 
one, does not vest till that age is attained, unless the Legacy 
carries interest during that person's infancy. 

STAPLETON v. CHEALES. [1711] 
(Prec. Chan. 317 ; 2 Vern. 673.) 

A legacy of 50/. was bequeathed to J. Stapleton when of the 
age of twenty-one. Interest was in the meantime to be paid 
quarterly. J. Stapleton died before he was twenty-one years 
old. 

Held, the legacy vested became it carried interest, and 
therefore went to the executors of the deceased. 

A legacy bequeathed to an infant payable or to be paid 
at the age of twenty -one is an interest vested, so that it 
shall go to the executors or administrators of the infant 
though he dies before that age. If, however, a legacy is 
bequeathed to a person at twenty-one, or if or token he shall 
attain the age of twenty-one, it does not vest till that age is 
attained unless the legacy carries interest during that 
person, s infancy. 

Note. — This case only applies to purely personal legacies. 



A Bequest to a Class, contingent on each reaching the age of 
twenty-one, vests as each attains twenty-one. 

IN EE HOLFOED, HOLFOED v. HOLFOED. [1894] 

(63 L. J. Ch. 637; (1894) 3 Ch. 30; 7 E. 304; 70 L. T. 777; 

42 W. E. 563.) 

A testator bequeathed the residue of his personal estate on 
trust to be divided amongst the children of Thomas Holford 

j. s 



258 PRO HATE. 

living at the testator's death who should attain the age of 
1 w enty-one years. Thomas Holford had six children living at 
the date of the testator's death, one of whom attained the age 
of twenty-one years on the 5th of June, 1893 ; the others were 
still infants. There was no maintenance clause in the will. 
The first child to come of age claimed to be entitled to one-sixth 
of the capital absolutely and, until another child attained twenty- 
one, the income of the remaining five- sixths. 

Held ^ by the Court of Appeal, that the eldest child on 
attaining twenty -one years took a vested interest in and tvas 
entitled to receive a one-sixth share only of the trust fund, 
and that the trustees were authorized by sect. 4-3 of the 
Conveyancing Act, 1881 (43 6f 44 Vict. c. 41), to apply 
the income of the other shares for the maintenance of the 
infant children contingently entitled thereto.

COMPANY. 



A One-man Company is Legal. 

SALOMON v. SALOMON. [1897] 
(66 L. J. Ch. 35 ; (1897) A. C. 22 ; 75 L. T. 426 ; 45 W. E. 193.) 

Mr. Salomon was a boot and shoe manufacturer, trading on 
his own sole account under the name of A. Salomon &amp; Co., in 
High Street, Whitechapel. 

Mr. Salomon formed a limited company with a nominal 
capital of 40,000/. The company consisted of himself, who 
took 20,000 shares, and of six other persons, who were members of 
his family, and held one 11. share each. The company so formed 
purchased Salomon's business, which at that time was perfectly 
solvent, at an over value, paying the price, 30,000/., by giving 
Salomon 20,000 fully paid 1/. shares and 10,000/. in deben- 
tures. 

Owing to bad trade the company failed, and it was found 
that the assets of the company were only worth 6,000/. ; while, 
in addition to the 10,000/. due to Salomon on the debentures, 
there was a sum of 7,000/. due to unsecured creditors. 

The unsecured creditors claimed to have the debentures set 
aside on the ground that the transaction was not a bond fide one 
but a sham. 

Held, the debentures ivere valid and the company pro- 
perly constituted. Where a trader who is solvent converts 
his business into a limited liability company, and all the 
statutory requirements for the constitution of the company 
are fulfilled, the Court is not entitled to go behind the 
register and memorandum, and upon a speculative analysis 

s2 



260 COMPANY. 

of motives and the exorbitance of the price paid, to decide 
that the company is not validly constituted on account of 
the non-fulfilment of conditions whieh are not found in the 
Companies Acts. 

The mere fact that the trader is virtually sole owner of 
the concern, the other shareholders having only a nominal 
interest and being members of his ovm family, and that he 
has received debentures secured on the business as part of 
the purchase-money, do not constitute the company his agent 
or trustee, so as to entitle the company to an indemnity or 
authorise the Court to rescind the agreement for the sale of 
the business to the company, or to deprive the founder of 
his security so as to postpone his claim on the assets to that 
of the unsecured, creditors. 



The Powers of a Company are limited by its Memorandum, and 
anything done beyond those Powers is ultra vires and void. The 
Memorandum can only be altered with the leave of the Court. 

ASHBUEY BAIL WAY CAEEIAGE CO. v. EICHE. [1874] 

(44 L. J. Ex. 185 ; L. E, 7 H. L. 671 ; 33 L. T 451.) 

The memorandum gave the company power " to make and 
sell, or lend on hire, railway carriages and wagons, and all 
kinds of railway plant, fittings, machinery and rolling stock ; 
to carry on the business of mechanical engineers and general 
contractors ; to purchase, lease, work and sell mines, minerals, 
land and buildings; to purchase and sell, as merchants, timber, 
coal, metals or other materials, and to buy and sell any such 
materials on commission, or as agents." 

The articles contained the following clause : " An extension 
of the business beyond, or for other than the objects or purposes 
expressed or implied in the memorandum of association, shall 
take place only in pursuance of a general resolution." 



COMPANY. 261 

The directors entered into a contract with Riche for the 
purchase of a railway concession in Belgium, and the company, 
by special resolution, duly ratified the contract. The question 
now raised was whether this contract was a good one. 

Held, that the contract was ultra vires the company, 

and therefore altogether bad. The rights and powers of a 
company incorporated muter the Companies Acts are limited 
by reference to the objects and purposes specified in the 
memorandum of association as those for which the company 
is established. 

The company exists only for those objects and purposes, 
and any act done or contract made by the company in 
attempt to extend them, or which is at variance with or goes 
beyond the scope of the memorandum of association, is ultra 
vires the company and absolutely void and incapable of 
ratification, though the whole body of shareholders should 
assent to such extension, act, or contract, and although such 
extension with such assent may be expressly contemplated 
by the articles of association, for the office of the articles of 
association is only to define and regulate the internal 
management of the company and the duties of its directors 
in carrying on its business. 



Where the Rights of different classes of Shareholders are set out 
in the Memorandum, they are only alterable with the consent 
of the Court. 

ASHBUBY v. WATSON. [1885] 
(54 L. J. Ch. 985 ; 30 C. D. 376 ; 33 W. E. 882.) 

By the memorandum of a company the rights of the 
preference and ordinary shareholders in respect of dividends 
were expressly defined. By special resolutions passed in 1872 it 



262 COMPANY. 

was resolved that the application of the revenue as between the 
preference and ordinary shareholders should be altered in a 
manner beneficial to the preference shareholders. 

These resolutions were acted on for more than ten years with- 
out any objection being raised on the part of any shareholder. 

Subsequently other special resolutions were passed restoring 
the original appropriation of the revenue prescribed by the 
memorandum of association. 

Held , that even if the resolutions passed in 1872 had 
been ratified by all the shareholders, yet the resolutions 
altered a condition contained in the memorandum, and were 
therefore invalid, and that the net revenue ought to be 
applied in the manner prescibed by the memorandum. 



Persons dealing with a Company are bound to see that a proposed 
transaction is not inconsistent with the Registered Documents 
of the Company, but are not bound to see that all the internal 
proceedings are regular. 

THE ROYAL BRITISH BANK v. TURQUAND. [1857] 
(25 L. J. Q. B. 317 ; 6 E. &amp; B. -327 ; 1 Jur. N. S. 1086.) 

By the deed of settlement of a joint-stock company, the 
directors were authorized to borrow under the common seal of 
the company such sums as should from time to time, by a reso- 
lution passed at a general meeting of the company, be authorized 
to be borrowed, not to exceed a certain sum. At a general 
meeting the directors were authorized to borrow such sum and 
at such interest and for such periods as they might deem ex- 
pedient in accordance with the provisions of the deed of settle- 
ment and the Act of Parliament. The directors borrowed 
1,000/. on bond under the common seal of the company. 

Held, that the company were liable to repay the amount 
whether the resolution was or was not a sufficient authority 



COMPANY. 263 

to the directors to borrow, for though parties dealing ivith 
joint-stock companies are bound to read the deed or statute 
limiting the directors' authority, the// arc not bound to do 
more. The plaintiffs, therefore, assuming them to have read 
this deed, would have found, not a prohibition to borrow, 
but a permission to borroiv on certain tilings being done. 
They have a right to infer that the company which 'put for- 
ward their directors to issue a bond of this sort have had 
such a meeting and such a resolution passed as was requisite 
to authorize the directors in so doing. 



Preference Shares may be created although not authorized by 
Memorandum or original Articles. 

ANDREWS v. GAS METER CO , LTD. [1897] 
(66 L. J. Ch. 246; (1897) 1 Ch. 361 ; 76 L. T. 132; 45 W. R. 321.) 

The company was formed and registered as a limited company. 
The company's original capital, as stated in its memorandum, 
was 60,000/., divided into 600 shares of 100/. each, with power 
to increase the capital as provided by the articles of association. 
By the articles power was given to the company to increase the 
capital, and it was provided that any new capital should be 
considered as part of the original capital. The issue of prefer- 
ence shares was not contemplated or authorized. 

Subsequently the company desired to acquire additional works, 
and passed a special resolution altering the articles, and autho- 
rizing the issue of 100 shares of 100/. each fully paid, and 
bearing a preferential dividend of 5/. per cent, per annum. 

The question to be decided was whether the preference shares 
were valid. 

Held, the preference shares ivere valid. There is no con- 
dition implied, in the absence of anything to the contrary 
in a memorandum of association, that all shareholders are

to be on an equal/'///. Therefore a company whose memo- 
randum and original articles do not authorize the issue of 
preference shares ran alter its articles so as to do so. 



A Company is liable for the Wrongs of its Agent, if committed in

the Wrong were its own. 

BAKWICK v. THE ENGLISH JOINT-STOCK BANK. 

[1866] 
(36 L. J. Ex. 147 ; L. E. 2 Ex. '259 ; 16 L. T. 461 ; 15 W. K. 877.) 

The plaintiff supplied oats to one Davis, a customer of the 
defendants' bank, for the purpose of enabling Davis to perform 
a contract with the Government for the supply of oats, on the 
faith of a guarantee given by the defendants' manager that on 
receipt of the money to be paid by the Commissariat Depart- 
ment to the defendants for Davis for the price of the oats 
supplied to the Government by Davis, the defendants would 
pay the plaintiff out of that money the sum due to him 
from Davis, subject only to the debt due to the bank from 
Davis. Davis was at the time so largely indebted to the bank 
that it was practically impossible that there should be any 
surplus to come to the plaintiff aiter pa\ ment of the debt due 
to the bank, but the manager concealed this from the plaint ill. 
The bank having appropriated the whole of the money to the 
payment of their own debt — 

Hebf, that on proof of these facts there ivas evidence to 
go to the jury of a false representation on the part of the 
manager of the defendant bank; that the defendants were 
answerable for such false represent" I inn • and that the false 
representation was properly described in the declaration as 
that of the defendants.

A Company issuing a Certificate that Shares are fully paid, is 
estopped from denying that Fact. 

BLOOMENTHAL v. FOED. [1897] 
66 L. J. Ch. 253 ; (1897) A. C. 156 ; 76 L. T. 205 ; 45 W. E. 449.) 

Bloomenthal applied to have his name removed from the list 
of contributories of Veuve Monnier et ses Fils. In 1894, the 
plaintiff was asked to lend the company 1,000/., and was induced 
to do so by the statement that he would have lodged with him 
as security 10,000 seven per cent, preference shares of the 
company, fully paid up, of the nominal value of 1/. each. The 
money was lent, and the certificates of the 10,000 shares, which 
stated they were fully paid up, were handed to the plaintiff, and 
he was eventually registered as a shareholder in respect of these 
shares. Nothing had in fact beon paid in respect of any of the 
shares, nor had any contract been filed in respect thereof. 

Held) Bloomenthal was entitled to have his name removed 
from the list of contributories. 

Where a man lends money to a company, and by way of 
collateral security accepts shares on the certificate of which 
it is stated that each of them is fully paid up, the company 
and the liquidator in its winding-up are estopped from 
denying the truth of the allegation on the faith of which the 
money was advanced, and the lender is entitled to have his 
name removed from the list of contributories. It is no 
answer to the lender's claim that he might by inquiry or 
refection have discovered that in fact nothing had been paid 
on the shares.

(75 L. J. K. B. 843; (1906) A. C. 439; 95 L. T. 214 ; 
13 Manson, 248; 22 T. L. E. 712.) 

Rowe, who was the secretary of the defendant company, 
applied to the plaintiffs, who were stockbrokers, to procure for 
him a loan of 20,000/. in order to enable him to purchase 5,000 
shares in the defendant company. The plaintiffs accordingly 
arranged with a firm of bankers to advance the money upon a 
transfer of the shares to their names. Rowe forged a transfer 
in the name of one Story as transferor. The transfer was duly 
executed by the bankers as transferees, and then the plaintiffs 
delivered it to Rowe in exchange for a certificate. The cer- 
tificate purported to state that the bankers were the registered 
proprietors of 5,000 shares ; it purported to be signed by two 
directors ; the seal was affixed to it ; and it was countersigned 
by Rowe himself as secretary. In fact the names of the two 
directors were forged by Rowe, and the company's seal was 
affixed by Rowe fraudulently, and not for or on behalf of or for 
the benefit of the defendant company, but solely for himself 
and for his own private purposes and advantage. Upon this 
the bankers advanced 20,000/. When the fraud was dis- 
covered, the plaintiffs were obliged to repay to the bank the 
sum of 20,000/., and brought this action against the defendant 
company upon the ground that they were liable for the fraud of 
Rowe. Rowe was admittedly a proper person to deliver cer- 
tificates on behalf of the company. 

Held, the company was not liable for the loss occasioned 
to the plaintiffs by the fraud of their secretary. 

A company is not liable in damages for loss sustained by 



COMPANY. 267 

the purchaser for value of a share certificate on which the 
names of the directors, whose signatures under the articles of 
association is necessary to the validity ', have been forged by 
the secretary. The fact that the certificate is in proper 
form and delivered by the secretary in the ordinary course 
of his duty, does not operate in such a case as a warranty 
or representation of genuineness or estop the company from 
denying the validity of the certificate. 



The Court will not interfere with the internal Administration of

MACDOUGALL v. GAEDINEE. [1875] 
(45 L. J. Oh. 27 ; L. B, 10 Oh. 606 ; 1 Ch. D. 13 ; 24 W. E. 118.) 

The articles of association of a company gave power to the 
chairman at any general meeting of the company, with the 
consent of the meeting, to adjourn the meeting, and also pro- 
vided for taking a poll if demanded by five shareholders. At a 
general meeting of the company the adjournment of the meeting 
was moved, and on being put was declared by the chairman, 
who was one of the directors, to be carried. A poll was duly 
demanded, but the chairman ruled that there could not be a 
poll on the question of adjournment, and left the room. One 
of the shareholders filed a bill on behalf of himself and all other 
shareholders except the defendants against the directors of the 
company, stating these facts and alleging that the course taken 
at the meetiug was taken in collusion with the directors with a 
view of stifling discussion, and that the directors were intending 
to carry out certain measures injurious to the company without 
submitting the terms to a general meeting ; and praying for a 
declaration that the conduct of the chairman was illegal and 
improper, and asking for an injunction to restrain the directors 



268 COMPANY. 

from carrying out the proposed arrangements without submitting 
them to the shareholders for their approval. 

Held, that the bill could not be sustained, for the rule 
must be adhered to, that nothing connected with internal 
disputes between the shareholders is to be made the subject 
of a bill by one shareholder on behalf of himself and "/hers 
unless there be something illegal, oppressive, or fraudulent, 
or something ultra vires on the pari of the company, or on 
the part of the majority of the company, so that they arc 
not fit persons to determine it. 

Note. — This is known as the rule in Foss v. Harbottle, 2 Hare, 
461. 



A material Misrepresentation, however innocent, is a ground for 
the Rescission of a Contract to take Shares if the application 
for Rescission is made within reasonable time. 

RE REESE RIVER SILVER MINING CO. LIMITED. [1867] 
(36 L. J. Ch. 618 ; L. R, 2 Ch. 604 ; 16 L T. 549 ; 15 W. R. 882.) 

A limited company was established for carrying on the 
business of a mining, smelting, and crushing company in 
Nevada, and acquiring any lands and effects for those purposes. 
The prospectus contained a statement that specified lands which 
had been contracted for by the company contained several very 
valuable claims, some of which were in full operation and 
making large daily returns, such statements having been made 
by the directors, not as hearsay, but as a fact within their own 
knowledge. This was the only property at that time contracted 
for. It having appeared subsequently that this description was 
quite incorrect, and that the property was worthless, the com- 
pany refused to complete the purchase, and contracted to buy 
other mines in Nevada. 

Mr. Smith, who had become a shareholder on the faith of the 



COMPANY. 269 

prospectus, received authentic notice of the misrepresentation 
on the 19th of January, and on the (&gt;th of February applied to 
be taken off the list of contributories. 

Held, that a material misrepresentation having been made, 
it was perfectly immaterial whether the directors when they 
made the representation in the prospectus believed it to be 
true, or did not believe it to be true, and that Smith, 
having come to the Court within reasonable time, was 
entitled to have his name taken off the list of contributories. 



A Contract induced by Fraud or Misrepresentation is Voidable, not 
Void. Shareholders cannot rescind after Winding-up. 

OAKES v. TUEQUAND. [1867] 
(36 L. J. Ch. 949 ; L. E. 2 H. L. 325 ; 16 L. T. 808.] 

Mr. Oakes had been induced to apply for shares to be allotted 
to him in Overend, Gurney &amp; Co. (Limited), by a prospectus 
which was false and fraudulent. 

The prospectus which was put forth by the seven directors of 
the new company, five of whom were connected with the old 
firm, was so framed as to lead the public to believe that the old 
concern was flourishing and profitable, whereas the five directors 
knew that it was insolvent to the amount of upwards of 
3,000,000/., and that no profits, but a loss, had been the annual 
result of their trading for nearly ten years immediately pre- 
ceding their publishing the prospectus. 

The plaintiff applied to have his name removed from the list 
of contributories to the liabilities of the company in the wind- 
ing up. 

Held, a contributory under the Companies Act, 1862, is 
a person who has agreed to become a member of a company 



270 COMPANY. 

and ivhose name is on the register. Tt matters not that his 
consent tvas obtained by fraud. 

The contract between a shareholder who has been deceived 
by a fraudulent prospectus and the company is voidable, 
not void, and cannot be avoided after the commencement of 
the winding up. 



A Floating- Debenture on the Property of a Company both Pressnt 
and Future is a good Charge. 

RE PANAMA MAIL CO. [1870] 

(39 L. J. Oh. 482 ; (1870) L. E. 5 Ch. 318 ; 22 L. T. 424 ; 
18 W. R. 441.) 

The question was whether a debenture holder having a deben- 
ture bond by which the company charged " the said undertaking 
and all sums of money arising therefrom, and all the estate, 
right, title, and interest of the company therein, with the pay- 
ment " of the bond debt could, on the company being wound 
up, claim the benefit of a lien upon all the assets of the com- 
pany in priority to general unsecured creditors. 

The bond was duly issued under the provisions of the articles 
of association of the company. 

Held, per Giffard, L. J., that a valid charge had been 
created over the property of the company, both present and 
future, against unsecured creditors. 

That the tvord "undertaking" had reference to all the 
property of the company, not only that which zvas in 
possession, but to all that which might be acquired after the 
date of the debenture. The word " undertaking" implied 
that the company ivould go on, and the contract of the deben- 



COMPANY. 271 

ture holder ?vas that if he received his interest he should, 
until the period of the payment of his principal arrived, not 
interfere with the business of the company, and should not 
be entitled to any account of past profits or dealings of the 
company. But the moment the company stops working and 
is wound up, the rights of the parties become clear ; and 
the debenture holders are in as good a position as if they 
had a specific charge upon the property of the company. 
If the company had not stopped, the debenture holders 
would, if unpaid, have a right to file a bill to realise their 
security. I hold that they have a charge upon all the 
property of the company, present and future, as against 
ordinary unsecured creditors. 



Where Shares are issued as fully-paid Shares in consideration of 
the transfer of Property, the Court will not, unless the 
Contract is impeached, inquire into the Value of the Con- 
sideration. 

PELL'S CASE. [1869] 
(39 L. J. Oh. 120; 5 Ch. 11; 21 L. T. 412; 18 W. E. 31.) 

Pell subscribed the memorandum of association for 1,350 
shares of the company. He, shortly after the incorporation of 
the company, sold property to the company in consideration of 
1,350 fully paid-up shares, the agreement for which sale had 
been adopted by the articles of association. The sale had not 
been impeached. On a summons to strike Pell's name off the 
list of contributories — 

Held, that the shares issued to Pell ivere issued in respect 
of the agreement for purchase of the business. That agree- 
ment had never been impeached nor had any evidence been 



272 COMPANY. 

furnished in /his or any proceedings against the agreement. 
The Court, therefore, cannot go behind the agreement and 
enquire into the value of the property given for the shares ; 
and as Pell, who subscribed for 1,350 shares, paid for them 
in money's worth, his name must be struck off the list of 
conlributories. 



BANKRUPTCY. 273 



BANKRUPTCY. 



Whether a Bankrupt is the " reputed Owner " of Goods in his 
" order and disposition " by the Consent and Permission of 
the Owner is a question of fact. 

IN EE WATSON &amp; CO. ; EX PARTE ATKIN. [1904] 

(73 L. J. K. B. 854; (1904) 2 K. B. 753; 11 Ma. 256; 

20 T. L. E. 727— C. A.) 

At the commencement of the bankruptcy of Messrs. Watson 
&amp; Co., they had on their premises certain goods belonging to 
Messrs. Atkin Brothers which had been sent to them as 
samples. These the trustee in bankruptcy claimed on the 
ground that they were in the possession, order, or disposition of 
the bankrupts, in their trade or business, by the consent and 
permission of the true owners, under such circumstances that the 
bankrupts were the reputed owners thereof, and the goods were 
consequently property divisible among the creditors of the 
bankrupts under sect. 44, sub-sect. 2 (iii) of the Bankruptcy 
Act, 1883. 

Held, that the question of reputed ownership is a question 
of fact in each case. Before a Court can hold that one 
maris goods are to be taken to pay another maris debts 
because of the reputation of ownership of the bankrupt, it 
is essential that the true owner of the goods should have 
consented to a state of things from ivhich he must have 
known, if he had considered the matter, flint the inference 
of ownership by the bankrupt must arise. 

J. T 



274 BANKRUPTCY. 

That Messrs. A I kin Brothers had not acquiesced in the 
bankrupts so dealing ivith the goods as to allow them to 
/mid themselves out as owners of the goods or to induce 
customer* to presume such ownership ; and the articles 
tvere, therefore, not in the order and disposition of the bank- 
rupts under such circumstances that they were the reputed 
owners thereof within the meaning of sub-sect. 2 (Hi) of 
sect. 44 of the Bankruptcy Act, 1883. 



Where Goods of another in the "order and disposition" of the 
Bankrupt pass to his Trustee, the true Owner is entitled to 
Damages for Breach of Bailment. 

IN EE HAVISIDE [1907] 

(76 L. J. K. B. 83b ; (1907) 2 K. B. 180; 97 L. T. 71 ; 14 Ma. 180; 

23 T. L. E. 422— C. A.) 

The debtor was adjudicated a bankrupt. on his own petition, 
and certain goods which had been left with him by one of his 
customers, Haviside, to be sold, or returned if not sold, were, by 
order of the Court, adjudged to be goods in the order and dis- 
position of the bankrupt with the consent of the true owner, 
and to pass to the trustee as property divisible amongst the 
creditors under sect, 44, sub-sect. 2 (iii) of the Bankruptcy 
Art, 1883. Haviside lodged a proof against the bankrupt's 
estate for 758/. 16*. 6d., which he claimed as the value of the 
goods, or, alternatively, as damages for the breach of an implied 
contract by the bankrupt that he would either sell the goods and 
account for the proceeds or would return them. 

Held, Haviside was entitled to prove in the bankruptcy for 

the damage he had sustained by reason of his goods not 
having been returned to him according to the terms of the 
bailment. 



BANKRUPTCY. 275 

Mutual Credits between a Creditor and a Bankrupt may be set 
off even though the Debt only ripens into such after the 
Bankruptcy. 

WATKINS v. LINDSAY &amp; CO. [1898] 
(67 L. J. Q. B. 362; 5 Mans. 25.) 

Cronmire, on April 15th, 1897, had a speculative account open 
with his brokers, the defendants, which might result on the 
next account day in a profit or a loss to him. "Wanting money 
on the 15th April, he ordered the defendants to sell some 
securities for cash, and received the proceeds in the form of a 
cheque for 161/. the same day. This cheque Cronmire put in 
his safe, meaning to cash it the next day. But the next day 
he died, and nothing was done with the cheque until after a 
creditors' administration order was made on April 24th for the 
administration of Cronmire's estate. On the 27th April the 
cheque was presented to the defendants' bank for payment, but 
was returned dishonoured, the defendants having in the mean- 
time stopped payment of it. On April 28th a sum became 
due to the defendants in respect of Cronrnire's speculative 
account, and the defendants claimed under the mutual debts 
and credits section of the Bankruptcy Act, 1883 (sect. 38), to 
set off against the plaintiff's claim an amount equal to the debt 
as due to them. 

Held, where there have been mutual dealings between a 
creditor and a debtor, the creditor is entitled as against the 
trustee in the administration of the insolvent debtor's estate, 
under sect. 125 of the Bankruptcy Act, 1883, to set off 
against his indebtedness a debt due to him from the insol- 
vent, although it has only ripened into a debt after the 
insolvent's death.

276 BANKRUPTCY, 



Trustee in Bankruptcy may disclaim an Onerous Lease. The 
Court may vest such disclaimed Lease in any person to whom 
it may seem just to vest it by way of Compensation for such 
Disclaimer. 

HOLMES, IN EE ASHWORTH. [1908] 
(77 L. J. K. B. 1129 ; (1908) 2 K. B. 812.) 

The lessee of land, subject to a rent of 150/., mortgaged by 
sub-demise four portions of it to four mortgagees. He did not 
mortgage the remaining portion nor deal with it in any way. 
He became bankrupt, and his trustee in bankruptcy disclaimed 
the lease. The four mortgagees applied for a vesting order of 
the whole land. 

Held, in the ordinary course of things, leasehold property 
belonging to the bankrupt would pass to his trustee in bank- 
ruptcy, but it might be a damnosa hereditas. The legis- 
lature, therefore, invented the plan of giving the trustee in 
bankruptcy an opportunity of divesting himself of the lease- 
hold property by disclaiming it. If there are no sub-leases 
no difficulty arises, and the lease would simply be surrendered 
to the landlord by operation of law. But in many cases sidt- 
leases have been granted, in which case a hardship may be 
created by such a surrender. Sect. 55 of the Bankruptcy 
Act protects these sub-lessees by giving the Court power to 
make an order for the vesting of the disclaimed property in 
or delivery /hereof to any person entitled thereto, or to whom 
it may seem jus I that the same should be delivered by way 
of compensation for such hardship. The mortgagees ivere, 
therefore, in this case, entitled to a vesting order of the 
whole of the land by way of compensation for their liability 
to pay the zvhole of the ground rent. 



BANKRUPTCY. 277 

Where a Conveyance by a Bankrupt to a Third Party is Fraudu- 
lent and therefore Void, such person cannot prove for the 
Consideration. 

EX PARTE MYERS. [1908] 
(77 L. J. K. B. 386 ; (1908) I K. B. 941 ; 15 Ma. 85.) 

By an agreement in writing dated August 17th, 1905, 
Joseph Myers sold his business to his brother, Abel Myers. 
Later in the same month Joseph Myers was adjudicated bank- 
rupt. The trustee in bankruptcy brought an action to set this 
transaction aside on the ground that it was a fraud and a sham, 
and as such was void. Abel Myers consented to a judgment 
against him in this action on the grounds that the agreement of 
17th August, 1905, was fraudulent against creditors, and void 
and of no effect. 

Abel Myers claimed to prove for the amount paid by him to 
his brother for the business. The proof was rejected by the 
trustee in bankruptcy. 

Held, per Divisional Court, that a person cannot prove 
for money paid by him in order to defraud creditors. So 
in this case, although Abel Myers had in fact paid the 
amount of 7501., and the bankrupt 1 s estate had had the 
benefit of that payment, yet he cannot prove in the bank- 
ruptcy for it, as it has been paid in the course of carrying 
out a transaction devised in fraud of the general body of 
creditors. 



A Payment by a Bankrupt in respect of a Breach of Trust to a 
co-Trustee or under a threat of criminal proceedings is not a 
fraudulent preference. 

IN RE TAYLOR. [1887] 
(56 L. J. Q. B. 195 ; (1887) 18 Q. B. D. 295 ; 35 W. R. 148.) 

The bankrupt, who was a stockbroker, and Taylor, who was 
a solicitor, were, with one other, trustees under the will of the 



278 BANKRUPTCY. 

bankrupt's father. Bonds, being part of the trust funds, were 
left in the bankrupt's custody. On the 25th of March, 1885, 
the bankrupt confessed to Taylor that he had forged transfers of 
certain of the securities, whereupon Taylor threatened to take 
him before the Lord Mayor on the charge of embezzlement. 
Thereupon the bankrupt gave Taylor a cheque for 3,000/., 
which was cashed the same day. On the 28th March the bank- 
rupt absconded, and on that act of bankruptcy was adjudicated 
a bankrupt on the 21st of April. 

The trustee of the bankrupt claimed the repayment of the 
3,000/. paid to Taylor by the bankrupt, on the grouud that it 
was a fraudulent preference. 

Held, the payment of money in respect of a breach of 
trust by a trustee to a co-trustee is not a payment " in 
favour of any creditor or any person in trust for any 
creditor'''' which may be a fraudulent preference within 
sect. 48 of the Bankruptcy Act, 1883. 

Held also, that a payment under a threat of criminal 
prosecution is not one u with a view of giving a creditor a 
preference over the other creditors.'''' 



The Court in Bankruptcy has power to go behind a Judgment and 
inquire into the Consideration, but not into the Form of 
Judgment. 

IN RE BEA.UCHAMP. [1904] 

(73 L. J. K. B. JJl 1 ; (1904) 1 K. B. 572 ; 90 L. T. 594 ; 52 W. R. 545 ; 
11 Ma. 5; 20 T. L. R. 269.) 

In this case a receiving order was made against Mrs. Beau- 
chanip, a divorced wife, who at the time of the making of the 
order was a single woman. The order was obtained for the 



BANKRUPTCY. 279 

ii&lt; m- compliance with a bankruptcy notice calling on her to pay 
a sum of money due under a judgment. The judgment was 
wrong in form, and Mrs. Beauchamp claimed to have it set 

aside. 

Held, the power of the Court in bankruptcy to go behind 
a judgment is a power to inquire into the consideration and 
not into the form of the judgment, and the judgment is con- 
clusive unless the consideration can be questioned. 



The Bankruptcy Court is not a Debt-collecting Agency, and will 
refuse to make a receiving order if there be " sufficient 
cause," e.g., where Debtor is threatened with Bankruptcy if 
he does not pay. 

IN EE GOLDBEKG. [1904] 
(21 T. L. E. 139.) 

The debtor, who had assigned the whole of his property for 
the benefit of his creditors, offered to pay all his creditors a com- 
position of 7s. 6r/. in the pound. This offer the majority of the 
creditors accepted, but one of the creditors insisted on an imme- 
diate cash payment of 7s. 6d. in the pound and bills for 2s. Qd. 
in the pound backed by a relative of the debtor, and threatened 
that if this were not done he would present a bankruptcy 
petition. This being refused, a bankruptcy petition was pre- 
sented. 

Held, that as the petitioning creditor had endeavoured to 
obtain a secret advantage over the other creditors tvith a 
threat, if the debtor did not concede it. to present a bank- 
ruptcy petition* there was u sufficient cause'''' for declining 
to make a receiving order within sect. 7, sub-sect. 3 of the 
Bankruptcy Act, 1883. 



280 BANKRUPTCY. 

Annulment of Adjudication on payment of Debts in full is dis- 
cretionary, and Court may postpone same for grave offences 
against the Law of Bankruptcy. 

IN EE TAYLOR; EX PAETE TAYLOR. [1901] 
(70 L. J. K.B. 531 ; (1901) 1 K. B. 744 ; 8 Ma. 230; 84 L. T. 426 ; 

49 W. E. 510.) 

Edwin Taylor was adjudicated bankrupt on the 24th October, 
1899. Search by his trustee in bankruptcy revealed the fact 
that much of the bankrupt's property was undisclosed by 
him, and that a bill of sale he had pretended to grant was a 
bogus one. 

On February 19th, 1901, the debtor, having paid the debts 
in full, applied for an order annulling the adjudication, but the 
registrar refused the application on the ground that he believed 
that the debtor had done his utmost to defraud his creditors ; 
that the debtor had set up a bogus bill of sale over his furni- 
ture ; that he had wilfully concealed his assets ; and that his 
sworn statement of affairs was false from beginning to end. 
From this decision the debtor appealed. 

Held, the annulment of a debtor's adjudication under 
sect. 35 of the Bankruptcy Act, 1883, does not follow as a 
matter of course upon proof that all the debts have been 
paid in full. The power to annul adjudications given to the 
Court is discretionary, and the Court will by refusing, or at 
any rate postponing, the annulment, punish a debtor who 
has been guilty of grave offences against the law of bank- 
ruptcy. 

The Registrar was perfectly right in the exercise of his 
discretion, having regard to the debtor s misconduct, to 
refuse to annul the adjudication. 



BANKRUPTCY. 281 

An Undischarged Bankrupt may not dispose of after-acquired 
Property except for Value. Any such gifts are void as 
against the Trustee in Bankruptcy. 

IN RE BENNETT ; EX PARTE OFFICIAL RECEIVER, 

[1907] 

(76 L. J. K. B. 134 ; (1907) 1 K. B. 149; 95 L. T. 887; 14 Ma. 6; 

23 T. L. R. 99.) 

Arthur J. Bennett was adjudicated a bankrupt on Decem- 
ber 8th, 189b, and the official receiver acted as trustee in the 
bankruptcy. There were no assets of any value, and the 
liabilities amounted to about 300/. 

Subsequently to the adjudication aud about eighteen months 
before his death, the debtor took out two policies of insurance 
on his life, and paid the premiums on them till his death. On 
his death letters of administration were taken out by Percy 
Bennett, who distributed the estate, which consisted of the pro- 
ceeds of the policies, between himself and the other next of kin 
of the debtor. Neither the administrator nor the other next of 
kin had any notice of the bankruptcy. After this distribution 
of the net proceeds of the policy moneys the trustee became 
aware for the first time of the existence of these moneys, and 
moved for an order declaring the policy moneys paid by the 
administrator of the bankrupt to be part of the property of the 
debtor under sect. 44 (1) of the Bankruptcy Act, 1883, and 
directing the payment of such moneys to the trustee. 

Held, the bankrupt is an agent of the trustee to deal with 
after-acquired property, not to give it away. He cannot 
defeat the operation of sect. 44 of the Bankruptcy Act, 
1883, by giving away after-acquired property ; nor can his 
next of kin retain against the trustee shares in such pro- 
perty, even though received by them in good faith without 
notice of the bankruptcy on their part or that of the 
administrator. 

That until a trustee intervenes all transactions by a 



282 BANKRUPTCY. 

bankrupt with any person dealing with him bona fide and 
for value in respect of his after -acquired property, whether 
with or without knowledge of the bankruptcy ', are valid 
against the trustee. 

Note. —The Last paragraph does not apply to after- acquired real 
property. See London and County Contracts v. Tallack, infra. 



An Undischarged Bankrupt can pass no Property in after-acquired 
Real Estate (including leaseholds) even to a bona fide Pur- 
chaser for Value. 

LONDON AND COUNTY CONTRACTS v. TALLACK. [1903] 
(51 W. R. 408.) 

The plaintiffs claimed a declaration that they were entitled to 
the equity of redemption of certain freehold land which they 
had purchased from Greorge Carter, an undischarged bankrupt. 
The plaintiffs were bond fide purchasers for value without notice 
of the bankruptcy. 

Held, that the plaintiffs were not entitled to the equit/j of 
redemption, for at the date when Carter acquired the pro- 
perty he was an undischarged bankrupt, and he could only 
acquire it for the benefit of his trustee m bankruptcy, and 
could not, therefore, give a good title to the plaintiffs. 

The rule that until the trustee in bankruptcy intervenes, 
all transactions by a bankrupt after his bankruptcy with 
any person dealing with him bona fide and for value in 
respect of his after-acquired properly, and whether with or 
without knowledge of the bankruptcy , are valid as against 
the trustee, does not apply I" real estate. 



BANKRUPTCY. 283 

Debts incurred after Notice of Act of Bankruptcy are not 
recoverable by the Creditor. 

BUCKWELL v. NORMAN. [1898] 

(67 L. J. Q. B. 435 ; (1898) 1 Q. B. 622 ; 5 Ma. 64 ; 78 L. T. 248 ; 

46 W. R. 339.) 

The defendant applied to the plaintiff, a solicitor, to file his 
petition in bankruptcy, and in doing so committed an act of 
bankruptcy. The plaintiff filed the petition, and subsequently 
a receiving order was made against the defendant. Costs were 
incurred in the bankruptcy proceedings between the date of the 
act of bankruptcy and the making of the receiving order. The 
plaintiff received from the estate, under rule 125 of the Bank- 
ruptcy Rules, 1886, the sum of about 4/. in respect of the 
costs incurred in filing the petition. The plaintiff then sued to 
recover the balance. 

Held, that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, upon 
the ground that the costs were a " provable debt" within 
sect. 37, sub-sect. 3, of the Act of 1883, although the 
plaintiff could not prove for them in the bankruptcy under 
sub-sect. 2, because at the time ivhen they were incurred he 
had notice of an act of bankruptcy committed by the 
defendant. 

A Married Woman can only be made Bankrupt in respect of her 
Separate Estate when she is Trading separately from her 
Husband. A Spinster who commits an Act of Bankruptcy 
escapes being made a Bankrupt by Marriage before adjudi- 
cation. 

IN RE DEBTOR; EX PARTE DEBTOR. [1898] 

(67 L. J. Q. B. 820 ; (1898) 2 Q. B. 576 ; 78 L. T. 824 ; 46 W. R. 

675; 5 Hanson, 122— C. A.) 

At the time when judgment was recovered and the petition 
was presented the debtor was a spinster. She induced the 



284 BANKRUPTCY. 

Court to let the petition stand over, and during the interval got 
married. It was admitted that she had not been carrying on 
business separately from her husband. 

Three weeks after the debtor's marriage the petition was 
heard and a receiving order was made against the debtor. 

The debtor appealed, and asked that the order might be 
discharged. 

Held, by the Court of Appeal, the debtor could not be 
made bankrupt, and the order must be discharged, for it is 
clear that a married woman van only be made bankrupt in 
respect of her separate estate when she is trading separately 
from her husband. 



DIVORCE AND MATRIMONIAL CAUSES. 285 



DIVORCE AND MATRIMONIAL CAUSES. 



DIVORCE. 



Where both Parties are guilty of Adultery no Decree will be 
granted except under exceptional circumstances. 

STOKEE v. STOKEE. [1889] 
(58 L. J. P. 40 ; 14 P. D. 60 ; 60 L. T. 400 ; 37 W. E. 576.) 

In this case there were cross petitions charging adultery in 
each case. The jury found that the wife had been guilty of 
adultery and the husband of incestuous adultery. 

Held, that both petitions must be dismissed. The discre- 
tionary power given to the Court by sect. 31 of the Divorce 
Act, 1857, to pronounce a decree nisi in favour of a 
'petitioner ivho had been guilty of adultery, is to be exercised 
only under very exceptional circumstances, and there were 
none such in the present case to justify a decree. 



Where a Husband deserts his Wife and the Wife within two years 
thereof obtains a Separation Order, the Wife cannot, after the 
expiration of the two years, rely on that as Desertion which, 
coupled with Adultery, would be sufficient grounds for 

Divorce. 

DODD v. DODD. [1906] 
(75 L. J. P. 49 ; (1906) P. 189 ; 94 L. T. 709 ; 54 AV. E. 541 ; 

70 J. P. 163; 22 T. L. E. 484. J 
The parties, who were married in 1891, separated in August, 
1896, the petitioner leaving her husband, who had given way to 



286 DIVORCE AND MATRIMONIAL CAUSES. 

drink and neglected to provide for her and her child. On 
September 9th, 1896, the wife obtained an order under the 
Summary Jurisdiction (Married Women) Act, L895, on the 
ground of wilful neglect by the husband to provide reasonable 
maintenance for her and her infaut child, with among others a 
provision that she be no longer bound to cohabit with her 
husband. This provision while in force has, by the Act, the 
effect in all respects of a judicial separation. 

The husband failed to comply with the money provision of 
the order, and adultery on his part in the year 1905 was 
established to the satisfaction of the Court. 

Held, the wife having obtained a separation order under 
the Summary Jurisdiction [Married Women) Act, 1895, 
the effect of ivhich was to prevent the continuance of the 
desertion after the date of the order, there was no desertion 
by the husband for the space of two years and upwards 
without reasonable excuse so as to satisfy sect. 27 of the 
Matrimonial Causes Act, 1857, and the petitioner was not 
therefore entitled to a decree for dissolution of marriage. 



Where Adultery has been condoned, subsequent Misconduct short 
of Adultery will revive the condoned Adultery. 

RIDGWAY v. RIDGWAY. [1881] 

(29 W. R. 612.) 

The wife petitioned for a dissolution of marriage on the 
ground of her husband's adultery and cruelty. 

The respondent alleged that the adultery and cruelty had 
been condoned. 

The wife admitted the condonation, but there was evidence 
that the respondent had taken liberties with and solicited the 
chastity of a female servant. 



DIVORCE. 287 

Held, condonation only constituted a conditional forgive- 
ness, and that misconduct of that /rind on the husband 1 s 
part, though falling short of actual adultery, is a breach of 
the condition of forgiveness, and that therefore the cruelly 
and adultery, although condoned, were revived by the 
husband' 's misconduct. 



Condonation of Adultery after Decree nisi for which obtained is a 
ground for Rescission of Decree. 

EOGEES v. EOGEES. [1894] 
(63 L. J. F. 97 ; (1894) F. 161 ; 6 E. 650 ; 70 L. T. 699.) 

A decree nisi was pronounced on the wife's petition. Subse- 
quently the Queen's Proctor intervened and established, first, 
that the petitioner had, subsequent to the decree nisi, condoned 
the adultery on account of which it had been pronounced by 
allowing her husband to come to her house and go into her bed- 
room, although there was no evidence that they had slept together, 
and going out with him ; and secondly, that the petitioner and 
respondent had been guilty of collusion for the purpose of con- 
cealing such condonation by making their meetings as secretly 
as possible. It was further established that the respondent had 
been guilty of adultery subsequent to such condonation. 

Held, that the parties having been found guilty oj collu- 
sion, the decree nisi must be rescinded and the petition 
dismissed, and that it was immaterial whether the condoned 
adultery had been revived by the subsequent adultery of the 
respondent or not ; but, secondly, that the petitioner might 
nevertheless succeed in obtaining a dissolution on filing a 
fresh petition alleging such adultery. 



288 DIVORCE AND MATRIMONIAL CAUSES. 

Desertion of Husband by Wife going to live with her Paramour is 
Conduct conducing to Adultery. 

CONST ANTI NIDI v. CONSTANTINIDI. [1903] 
(72 L. J. P. 82 ; (1903) P. 246 ; 89 L. T. 340 ; 52 W. R. 190.) 

The husband petitioned for dissolution of his marriage with 
the respondent on the ground of her adultery, and there was a 
cross petition charging the husband with adultery. 

In 1897 the wife deserted the husband, and in 1899 the 
husband obtained a decree of judicial separation on the ground 
of his wife's desertion. In 1902 the wife divorced her husband 
in the State of Dakota, U.S.A., on the ground of his cruelty, 
and then went through the form of marriage with the co- 
respondent, and they had since cohabited as man and wife. 

The petitioner had on several occasions committed adultery 
after his wife's desertion. 

Held, that the adultery of the husband subsequent to the 
desertion was no defence to his petition, as the wife had 
been guilt// of conduct conducing to it. 

A wife ivho leaves her husband because she has trans- 
ferred her affections to another man, and ivhose hush/aid 
correctly assumes this to be so, is in a serious degree 
responsible for the subsequent misconduct of the husband, 
and will not be allowed to evade the consequences of her 
otvn misconduct by alleging that of the husband. 



Leaving a Wife without Means is Conduct conducing to her Adul- 
tery, especially in the case of a woman who was a Prostitute 
before Marriage. 

COULTHART v. COULTHART. [1859] 
(28 L. J. P. &amp; M. 21.) 

On a petition for dissolution of marriage on the ground of the 
wife's adultery, it appeared that the petitioner, a draper's assistant, 



DIVORCE. 289 

then twenty-one years of age, married in 1853 a woman whom 
he well knew to be a prostitute. A montli after the marriage 
they removed from lodgings to the house of the petitioner's 
father, from which, after a stay of a few weeks, they were com- 
pelled to remove in consequence of the wife exhibiting bad 
temper and making herself disagreeable to the family. Ten 
days afterwards, the husband went to America, not on business, 
but because he lived unhappily with his wife, leaving her with- 
out means of subsistence, and supplying her with none during 
an absence of four years. After he left, his family had given 
the wife a small pittance on one occasion, but in consequence of 
her annoying them, all intercourse was broken off. The wife, 
after her husband left, returned to her former way of life. 

The Court held that before the marriage the wife was living 
an immodest and immoral life, and that was perfectly well 
known to the husband, and it was therefore necessary for 
him, considering her former course of life, to exercise the 
greatest vigilance and caution over her conduct. There ivas 
a wilful separation of the husband from the wife before the 
adultery complained of ivhich had been without reasonable 
excuse, and in exercise of the discretion given them by 
20 6f 21 Vict. c. 85, s. 31, the Court refused to decree a 
dissolution of the marriage. 



Re-marriage before Decree Nisi made Absolute will not prevent 
the Decree being made Absolute if Second Marriage is 
contracted in belief that the Decree had been made absolute. 

WICKHAM v. WIOKHAM. [1880] 
(49 L. J. P. 70 ; 6 P. D. 11 ; 43 L. T. 445.) 

In 1868 the wife obtained a decree nisi on the ground of her 
husband's cruelty and adultery. On the day of the granting of 
the decree nisi her solicitor, who had since died, told her that 

j. u 



290 DIVORCE AND MATRIMONIAL CAUSES. 

the obtaining of a decree absolute was a mere matter of form 
which he would see to without troubling her. Believiug that 
all the necessary things had been done and that the decree nisi 
had been made absolute, she, on the 17th of September, 1871, 
went through a ceremony of marriage with another man. It 
was not till the 8th of May, 1880, that she discovered that the 
decree had not been made absolute and that consequently her 
second marriage was invalid. 

She now applied to have the decree made absolute. No 
opposition was offered by the Queen's Proctor. 

Held, in the circumstances, the Court would make the 
decree absolute. 



NULLITY. 



Nullity will be decreed where Marriage Ceremony gone through 
in Ignorance of its being a Marriage Ceremony. 

HALL v. HALL. [1908] 
(24 T. L. E, 756.) 

In the year 1905 the respondent, who was engaged to the 
petitioner, accepted an appointment in Penang, for which place 
he had to leave England early in January, 1900. It was 
arranged that he should get a home ready for the petitioner, 
and that they should be married in the autumn. Just before 
he left, when the young couple were out for a walk together, 
they passed a place which the petitioner subsequently learnt to 
be the Kensington Register Office. The respondent casually 
said, " Oh ! let's go in and put our names down to be married." 
After some pressing she did so, and they went in together and 
were duly married by the registrar. She was all the time 
under the impression that it was a mere form of betrothal, as 
she entertained the belief that a marriage could only take place 



FORM OF MARRIAGE. 291 

in a church. She said she had not paid any attention to the 
questions put to her by the registrar, and never had any idea 
that she was being married. The respondent, it appeared, was 
equally innocent, and although he had in December, 1905, given 
the proper notices for a valid marriage at the Register Office, yet 
his letters written to her from Penang showed clearly that he 
had no idea that lie was married, as he was planning to be 
married to her in Penang. 

After they left the register office they went to a theatre to see 
" Peter Pan." The marriage was never consummated. 

Held, per Gorell Barnes, P., that a person who was not 
paying attention to what the registrar was saying might not 
appreciate what the form of his words meant. The 
marriage never having been consummated, and there being 
nothing in the correspondence to suggest that they knew 
they were married, he would pronounce a decree of nullity. 



FORM OF MARRIAGE. 



Restrictions and Prohibitions against Marriage are governed by 
the lex loci contractus, even though one of the two parties 
thereto is domiciled abroad. 

OGDEN v. OGDEN. [1907] 
(76 L. J. P. 9; (1907) P. 107; 96 L. T. 505; 23 T. L. E, 158; 
affirmed 77 L. J. P. 34 ; (1908) P. 46; 97 L. T. 827; 24 
T. L. E. 94.) 

A ceremony of marriage according to English form was cele- 
brated in England between Leon Philip, a domiciled French- 
man, and the respondent, a domiciled Englishwoman. This 
marriage was subsequently annulled in France at the suit of 
Leon Philip as being contrary to the law of his domicile, he 
having at the date of the celebration of it been under twenty- 

u 2 



292 DIVORCK AND MATRIMONIAL CAUSES. 

one years of age, and not having obtained his father's consent. 
At a later date, and while he was still living, the woman married 
an Englishman in England. 

Held, that this latter ceremony ivas bigamous, and there- 
fore to be annulled at the suit of the man party to it. 

Restrictions and prohibitions against marriage are decided 
upon by the law of the place where the marriage is celebrated. 
No nation can call upon another nation within whose 
territory a marriage is celebrated to surrender its own laivs 
to give effect to restrictions and prohibitions of marriage of 
the former nation. 

In the case of a marriage in England, ivhere the marriage 
is valid of a British woman domiciled in England with a 
man domiciled in a country where in the circumstances the 
marriage would be invalid, the law of England, as the place 
ivhere the marriage is celebrated, ivill prevail as the proper 
test, at all events in England, of the validity of the marriage. 

Note. — Sottomayor v. De Bar ros (49 L. J. P. 1), which is the lead- 
ing case on this point, is not set out here, as the proceedings in that 
case are somewhat puzzling to a student. 

Note also, that the above doctrine would not apply if both 
parties were domiciled abroad at the time of the marriage, even 
though the marriage took place in England. 



CUSTODY OF CHILDREN. 293 



CUSTODY OF CHILDREN. 



Legal Custody of Children is in Husband, but where he is guilty 
the Custody may be given to Wife if blameless, or to Third 
Parties if not blameless. 

CHETWYND v. CHETWYND. [1865] 

(35 L. J. Mat. 21 ; L. E. 1 P. 39 ; 4 Sw. &amp; Tr. 151 ; 11 Jur. (N. S.) 

958 ; 13 L. T. 474 ; 14 W. E. 184.) 

A decree absolute having been pronounced against the husband 
on the ground of his cruelty and adultery, applications were made 
for the custody of the two infant children of the marriage by 
their father and mother and by third persons who had been 
allowed to intervene for the benefit of the children. The two 
children were eight and ten years old respectively. 

Held, when parents cease to live together the legal right 
to the custody of children of this age is with the father. 
But where the home has been broken up by the conduct of 
the father, the Court frequently exercises its poiver in favour 
of the injured mother. The wife, however, must be blameless 
in order to justify the Court feeling at liberty to abrogate in 
favour of a wife the legal right of her husband to the custody 
of the children. 

The Court being of opinion that in this case neither the 
father nor the mother were fit to be entrusted with the care 
and custody of the children, gave the custody of them to the 
interveners, relatives of the husband, but directed that the 
parents should be allowed reasonable access. 



294 ADMIRALTY. 



ADMIRALTY. 



Crew are not entitled to Salvage till after bona fide Abandonment 
of Vessel. Passengers are entitled to Salvage if they volun- 
tarily stay on board and use extraordinary exertions. 

THE VREDE. [1861] 
(30 L. J. P. 209 ; Lush. 322.) 

Certain passengers who were on board the Dutch barque 
Vrede brought this action against the owners of the barque for 
services rendered by them in pumping the vessel after she had 
sustained damage by a collision with the Victor off the South 
Foreland. 

The ship was in no immediate danger of sinking, and the 
passengers, at the request of the master, remained on board after 
the collision and assisted at pumping her until her arrival in 
port. 

Held, this ivas not such service as to entitle the plaintiffs 
to salvage reward. 

Where there is a common danger it is incumbent on all 
to assist. To entitle passengers to retvard for civil salvage 
there must be a voluntary remaining on board, accompanied 
with extraordinary exertions on behalf of the ship. 

Salvage service may be performed by the seamen oj the 
ship salved, ivhcn an abandonment of her has put an end to 
their original contract. 



ADMIRALTY. 295 

Generally the Owner is not liable for Damages caused by the 
Collision of his Ship with another where there is Compulsory 
Pilotage and Pilot is in command. 

THE OAKFIELD. [1886] 

(55 L. J. P. 11; 1 1 P. D. 34 ; 54 L. T. 578 ; 34 W. E. 687 ; 
5 Asp. M. C. 575.) 

The defendants were the owners of the Oakfield, which, while 
under the command of a pilot, collided with the Duchess of 
Albany while at anchor. The weather was foggy at the time, 
and vessels could only be seen when within a few hundred 
yards. The defendants, while admitting that the Oakfield was 
to blame, pleaded compulsory pilotage. The plaintiffs con- 
tended, however, that the captain, by interfering with the pilot's 
control of the ship, had rendered the owners liable. 

Held, a mere suggestion by the captain of a ship to the 
pilot as to the orders that should be given, not amounting to 
an interference, will not transjer the responsibility to the 
master, so as to render the owners liable if the order is a 
negligent one. 

It is within the province of the pilot compulsorily in 
charge of a vessel to decide whether the state of the weather 
is or is not such as to render it imprudent to get under 
way. 

But, semble, the fog may be so dense that the captain 
of a ship would not be exonerated if he allowed his vessel to 
be got under way. 



296 ADMIRALTY. 

The Shipper of Goods to be carried on Deck which are jettisoned 
is not entitled to Contribution by way of General Average. 

WEIGHT v. MAR WOOD. [1881] 

(50 L. J. Q. B. 643 ; 7Q.B. D. 62 ; 45 L. T. 297 ; 29 W. R. 673 ; 

4 Asp. M. C. 451.) 

The defendant shipowners contracted with the plaintiff to 
carry his cattle, on deck, from New York to Portsmouth. No 
custom to carry cattle on deck existed. During the voyage the 
ship encountered heavy weather, and the master made a proper 
and necessary jettison of the cattle. 

He Id , that when such a sacrifice is made, as was here, 
for the common good, as a rule it comes within general 
average, and must be borne proportionately by those in- 
terested. To this rule there is an exception, namely, deck 
cargo jettisoned is not entitled to general average contri- 
bution, and therefore the plaintiff was not entitled to 
contribution by the defendants in respect of his loss either 
by way of general average on ship, freight and cargo, or as 
a particular right to contribution from the defendants alone. 



A Wrong Manoeuvre by one Ship which places another in ex- 
treme Danger will exonerate that other if she, not being 
manoeuvred with perfect skill and presence of mind, does 
something wrong. 

THE BYWELL CASTLE. [1879] 
(4 P. D. 219 ; 41 L. T. 747 ; 28 W. R. 293 ; 4 Asp. M. C. 207.) 

The Princess Alice, a pleasure steamer, was going down the 
Thames after dark on the evening of the 3rd of September, 
1878, while the Bywell Castle was going in the opposite direc- 
tion on a parallel course, so that if their respective courses had 



ADMIRALTY. 297 

been continued they would have passed at a safe distance from each 
other. When a very short distance intervened between the two 
vessels, the master of the Princess Alice ordered the helm to be 
put a-starboard, by which he brought his vessel athwart the 
bows of the Bywell Castle. The two ships being so close 
together his manoeuvre rendered a collision inevitable. The 
Bijivell Castle, which had up to that point been navigated with 
due care and skill, was then hard a-ported. The two ships 
collided, and the Princess Alice went down, and more than 500 
of her passengers and many of her crew, including the captain, 
were drowned. It was found that the Princess Alice was navi- 
gated in a careless and reckless manner, without due observance 
of the regulations, look-out and speed, and that although the 
Bynell Castle, when the two ships were close together, had 
wrongly manoeuvred in going hard to port, yet that manoeuvre 
did not have the slightest appreciable effect upon the collision. 

Held, the Princess Alice was alone to blame, for a 
ship has no right by its own misconduct to put another ship 
into a situation of extreme peril. If in that moment of 
extreme peril and difficulty such other ship happens to do 
something wrong so as to be a contributory to the mischief, 
that would not render her liable for the damage, inasmuch 
as perfect presence of mind, accurate judgment, and 
promptitude under all circumstances are not to be expected. 



298 PROCEDURE. 



PROCEDURE. 



The Defendant is entitled to Unconditional Leave to Defend under 
Ord. XIV. where there is a Triable Issue although it may 
appear that the Defence is not likely to succeed. 

JACOBS r. BOOTH'S DISTILLERY CO. [1901] 
(85 L. T. 262 ; 50 W. E. 49— H. L. (E.).) 

The defendant Jacobs in this case signed a memorandum of 
charge and two promissory notes with a co-defendant, who did 
not contest his liability, to secure an advance and further moneys. 
He received an indemnity from his co-defendant, and stated 
that he had been told that he incurred no liability by signing, 
and that he had signed the memorandum and two promissory 
notes relying on that representation. 

The plaintiffs brought their action for 3,294/., the amount 
due from the defendants. On an application under Ord. XIV. 
the Master ordered the amount to be paid into Court within 
seven days, with judgment if the sum was not so paid, and this 
order was affirmed on appeal by the judge at Chambers and by 
the Court of Appeal. 

Held, by Ike House of Lords, where there is a triable 
issue, though it may appear that the defence is not likely to 
succeed, the defendant should not be shut out from laying 
his defence before the Court, cither by having judgment 
entered against him or by being put under terms to pay 
money into Court as a condition of obtaining leave to 
defend. 



PROCEDURE. 299 

Judgment against one of two Persons severally liable precludes 
the Plaintiff proceeding against the other Person, as 
Ord. XIV., rule 5, does not apply. Where the Liability is 
Joint, the Plaintiff may sign Final Judgment against one 
without prejudice to his right to proceed against the 
other. 

MOREL BROS. v. EARL OF WESTMORLAND AND WIFE.

(73 L. J. K. B. 93 ; (1904) A. C. 11 ; 89 L. T. 702 ; 52 W. R. 353 ; 

20 Times Rep. 38.) 

The plaintiff brought this action to recover the price of wines 
and other goods supplied to the defendants, and signed judg- 
ment under Ord. XIV. against the Countess of Westmorland. 

The judgment was not, however, satisfied, and the plaintiff 
therefore proceeded against the Earl, her husband. 

Held, the plaintiff having by entering judgment against 
the wife as the agent of her husband elected to look to 
her alone as the contracting party, cannot get judgment 
against the principal ; also, as the remedy being an alter- 
native one, cannot be made available against the two, 
Ord. XIV., rule 5, does not apply. 

If the plaintiff had been able to establish a joint liability 
the plaintiff would not have been prejudiced by signing judg- 
ment under Ord. XIV. against one of the joint debtors, but 
might go on and show that the other debtor was a joint 
debtor. 

Note. — Ord. XIV., rule 5, provides: If it appears to the judge 
that any defendant has a good defence, or ought to be permitted to 
defend the action, and that any other defendant has not such 
defence and ought not to be permitted to defend, the former may 
be permitted to defend, and the plaintiff shall be entitled to enter 
final judgment against the latter, and may issue execution upon 
such judgment without prejudice to his right to proceed with his 
action against the former. 



300 PROCEDURE. 

If a necessary Co-Plaintiff refuses to join as Plaintiff after being 
tendered an Indemnity against Costs he should be made a 
Defendant. 

CULLEN v. KNOWLES AND BIRKS. [1898] 

(67 L. J. Q. B. 821 ; (1898) 2 Q. B. 380.) 

The plaintiff brought this action claiming damages for breach 
of contract to purchase a patent. The defendant Birks was the 
co-owner with the plaintiff of the patent but refused to allow 
his name to be used as a plaintiff, although an indemnity for 
costs had been tendered. 

By his defence the defendant Knowles relied on the conten- 
tion that the contract sought to be enforced was a joint contract 
between himself and the plaintiff and the defendant Birks, and 
that the plaintiff could not by himself maintain any action in 
respect thereof. 

Held, that Orel. X VI is explicit, that no person can be 
joined as a plaintiff without his consent in writing, and that 
therefore the plaintiff was entitled, after Jus co-owner had 
been tendered an indemnity against costs and had refused to 
be joined as -plaintiff in this action, to enforce a right in 
which they were jointly interested to join him as a defendant 
to the action. 



Where the same Libel is published in seventeen Newspapers, 

separate Actions must be brought against each to recover 

Damages from all. An order may, however, be made staying 

all the Actions but one pending the Trial of one as a Test 

Action. 

COLLEDOE v. PIKE. [1887] 

(56 L. T. 124 ; 3 Times L. E. 126.) 

The plaintiff brought this action against the defendant for 
damages for publication of a libel in his newspaper. He also 
brought sixteen separate actions against sixteen other publishers 



PROCEDURE. 301 

of newspapers for publishing the same libel in their respective 
newspapers. The owners of the seventeen newspapers there- 
upon made an application that all these actions might be 
consolidated. 

Held, the application to consolidate the seventeen actions 
must be refused, for although the libel was the same in each 
case, yet the circumstances attending the publication of each 
being different, the cause of action in the several cases was 
different. 

A stag of all the actions but one will, however, be granted 
pending the trial of one as a test action. 



A Solicitor's Bill is a Claim for a liquidated amount under 
Ord. III., rule 6, although liable to Taxation. 

SMITH v. ED WAEDES. [1888] 
(58 L. J. Q. B. 227 ; 22 Q. B. D. 10 ; 60 L. T. 10 ; 37 W. E. 112.) 

The plaintiff made an application under Ord. XIV., rule 1, 
for leave to sign final judgment for the amount of a solicitor's 
untaxed bill of costs. 

Held, this was a proper application under Ord. XIV., 
rule 1, and that the proper form of the order was that the 
bill of costs be referred to the Taxing Master, the plaintiff 
to give credit at the time of the taxation for all sums of 
money received by him from or on account of the defendant, 
and that the plaintiff be at liberty to sign final judgment for 
the amount of the Masters allocatur in the said taxation. 

This order preserves to the parties their rights as to the 
cost of the taxation and as to objections to the taxation and 
appeal. 

An allocatur (it is allowed) is a certificate by a Master allowing 
costs. 



302 PROCEDURE. 

A specially indorsed Writ must set forth a full and complete 
Statement of the Claim and Cause of Action. 

FRUHAUF v. GROSVENOR &amp; CO. [1892] 
(61 L. J. Q. B. 717 ; 67 L. T. 350 ; 8 Times Rep. 744.) 

The Master had refused the plaintiff's application to sign 
final judgment under Ord. XIV., rule 1, upon the ground that 
the writ was improperly indorsed. The indorsement was as 
follows : — 

" The plaintiff's claim is 28*2/. 2s. 3d., balance of principal 
and charges due on a dishonoured cheque, and money had 
aud received by defendants to plaintiff's use." 
Then followed particulars showing how the plaintiff's claim was 
arrived at. 

The question was whether the omission of an allegation in 
the indorsement of the writ that the defendants had received 
due notice of the dishonour of their cheque precluded the 
plaintiff from obtaining an order for final judgment. 

Held) per Lord Coleridge, C.J., the indorsement was not 
sufficient. Where the machinery of a specially indorsed 
writ is put in motion^ the statement of claim indorsed must 
set forth a full and complete statement. Here the state- 
ment of the writ is not complete without an allegation of 
notice of dishonour, or of facts dispensing with it. 



Where a number of Persons have the same Interest in a Cause or 
Matter, one of the Persons so interested may sue on behalf 
of all the Persons so interested. 

BEDFORD v. ELLIS AND FIVE OTHERS. [1901] 
(70 L. J. Ch. 102 ; (1901) A. C. 1 ; 83 L. T. 686; 17 Times 

Rep. 139.) 

Ellis and five others, on behalf of themselves and all others 
the growers of fruit, flowers, vegetables, roots or herbs, sued the 



PROCEDURE. 303 

Duke of Bedford, the owner of Covent Garden Market, alleging 
infringement of their statutory rights by the defendant, and 
claiming an injunction and other relief. It was contended on 
behalf of the defendant that the plaintiffs were not entitled 
to be joined as such. 

Held, the plaintiff's were entitled to be Joined, for where 
there is a common interest and a common grievance, a repre- 
sentative action is in order if the relief sought is in its nature 
beneficial to all whom the plaintiffs purpose to represent ; 
and the rule is not limited to persons having a beneficial 
proprietary interest. And if the alleged rights of the class 
represented are being denied or ignored, it is of no moment 
whether or not the nominal plaintiffs have been wronged in 
their individual capacity. 



Either the Plaintiff or Defendant is entitled to a Jury unless the 

case is one in which the Judge has under Ord. XIV. given 

leave to defend upon terms that the Trial shall be without a 

Jury. 

WOLFE v. DE BEAAM. [1899] 

(81 L. T. 533 ; 48 W. K. 161 ; 16 Times Eep. 61.) 

Upon an application under Ord. XIV. for leave to enter final 
judgment, the judge made an order giving unconditional leave 
to defend ; and ordered the action to be put into the short 
cause list. The defendant then applied, on the summons for 
directions, for an order for a trial with a jury, but the judge 
refused to make the order. 

Held {allowing the appeal), that although the judge might 
have given leave to defend upon the terms that the trial 
should be without a jury , yet, as this had not been done, the 
defendant was entitled to an order for a trial with a jury 
under Ord, XXXVI., rule 6. 



304 PROCEDURE. 

Where the Defendant has not entered an Appearance and the 
Writ is not specially indorsed, the Plaintiff must file a 
Statement of Claim before signing Judgment by Default, 
although the Writ is indorsed for Trial without Pleadings. 

GREENE v. THE ST. JOHN'S MANSIONS (Liu.). [1900 J 
(35 L. J. N. C. 49 ; W. N. (1900) 9 ; 44 Sol. Jo. 175.) 

The plaintiff moved ex parte, for judgment against the 
defendant in default of appearance. The writ in this action 
was indorsed as follows : — " Plaintiff's claim is for a declaration 
that the written agreement of the 6th day of April, 1898, and 
made between the Rev. Charles Philip Greene of the first part, 
the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for England of the second part, 
Edward Wentworth Bowyer and Fairfax Blomfield Waite of the 
third part, and the defendants of the fourth part, whereby the 
defendants agreed to erect certain buildings on the glebe land 
belonging to the rectory of Holy Trinity, Clapham, described 
in the said agreement, is determined and at an end, and that 
the sum of 300/. therein mentioned has been forfeited to the 
Ecclesiastical Commissioners. 

" If the defendants appear to this writ of summons, the plain- 
tiff intends to proceed without pleadings." 

A question arose as to whether the plaintiffs having, in pur- 
suance of Ord. XVIIIa., rule 6, stated their intention to proceed 
to trial without pleadings, it was necessary for them to file a 
statement of claim before signing judgment by default. 

Held, that a statement of claim must be filed. 



If Material Facts are not pleaded, Evidence cannot be given of 
them at the Trial except on Terms. 

BROOK v. BROOK. [1887] 
(56 L. J. P. 108 ; 12 P. D. 19 ; 57 L. T. 425 ; 35 W. R. 351.) 

This was a wife's petition for dissolution of marriage on the 
ground of her husband's adultery, cruelty and desertion. 



PROCEDURE. 305 

The following were the allegations in the petition as to 
cruelty : — 

" That the said J. S. Brook was during all the cohabitation 
frequently drunk and treated her with cruelty. That he 
frequently disturbed her when lying in child -bed, and 
threatened her with violence and injured her health. That 
he wilfully neglected to provide her and her children with 
sufficient food and clothing. That he drew a carving-knife 
across her throat and caused her great fear." 

At the trial it was sought to give evidence of specific acts of 
cruelty by striking. 

Held, per Butt, J. : I do not think that a man ought to 
be charged with striking his wife without having due notice 
of it in the petition, which says nothing about a blow. I 
zvill allow the petition to be amended, but the respondent is 
entitled, if he desire it, to an adjournment to enable him to 
meet the charge. 



It is no part of the Statement of Claim to anticipate the Defence 
and to state what the Plaintiff would have to say in answer 
to it. 

HALL v. EVE. [1876] 

(46 L. J. Ch. 145 ; 4 C. D. 341 ; 35 L. T. 926 ; 25 W. E, 177.) 

The plaintiffs, in their reply to the defendants' statement of 
defence, pleaded a traverse to the statements contained in the 
defence, and further, that if those statements were true, they had 
a further answer to them, the plaintiffs thus traversing and 
avoiding the defendants' defence. 

The defence contended that this could not be pleaded by way 
of reply, but should be pleaded by amending the statement of 
claim. 

J. x 



306 PROCEDURE. 

Held, the traverse and avoidance was properly pleaded, 
for it is no part of the statement of claim to anticipate the 
defence, and to state tvhat the plaintiff ivould have to say in 
answer to it, for in pleading you must not leap till you come 
to the stile. 



Undue delay will Defeat the Right to strike out Pleadings on the 
ground that they disclose no cause of Action. 

CROSS v. HOWE. [1892] 
(62 L. J. Ch. 342; 3 R. 218.) 

The defendant applied to have the plaintiff's statement of 
claim struck out as frivolous and vexatious. 

Held, the defendant not having made the application until 
the pleadings ivere closed and the action set down for trial, 
the Court would not, on the ground of delay, grant the 
application which ivould otherwise have been acceded to. 



The object of Particulars is to ascertain the Case that has to be 
met at Trial so as to save unnecessary Expense and prevent 
Parties being taken by Surprise. 

SPEDDING v. FITZPATRICK. [1888] 
(58 L. J. Ch. 139 ; 38 C. D. 410 ; 59 L. T. 492 ; 37 W. R. 20.) 

A plaintiff brought an action to restrain the defendants from 
trespassing on a certain occupation road. The defendants, by 
their amended defence, stated that the said road had for very 
many years past been used as of right as a foot and horse way, 
and that the road had been dedicated to the public by the 
plaintiff or her predecessors in title, or some of them. On an 



MENS REA. 307 

application for particulars, which was heard on appeal by the 
Court of Appeal — 

Held, that the order ought to be : u If the defendants 
rely on any specific acts of dedication, or specific declara- 
tions of intention to dedicate, whether alone or jointly with 
evidence of user, let the defendants, within fourteen days, 
set forth the nature and dates of the said acts or declara- 
tions, and the names of the persons by whom the same were 
madeP 

That the object of particulars is to enable the party 
asking for them to know what case he has to meet at the 
trial, so that unnecessary expense may be saved and that 
parties may not be taken by surprise. 



CRIMINAL LAW. 



MENS REA. 



Mens rea is necessary to constitute Crime. A Second Marriage 
entered into in good faith and on reasonable grounds of 
belief in the death of husband or wife does not, therefore, 
constitute the Crime of Bigamy. 

K. r. TOLSON. [1889] 

(58 L. J. M. C. 97 ; 23 Q. B. D. 168 ; 60 L. T. 899 ; 37 W. E, 716 ; 
16 Cox, C. C. 629 ; 54 J. P. 4— C. C. E.) 

The prisoner married on the 11th of September, 1880. Her 
husband deserted her on the 13th of December, 1881, She and 

x2 



308 CRIMINAL LAW. 

her father made enquiries about him, and learned from his elder 
brother and from general report that he had been lost in a vessel 
bound for America, which went down with all hands on board. 

On the 10th of January, 1887, the prisoner, supposing herself 
to be a widow, went through the ceremony of marriage with 
another man. The circumstances were well known to the 
second husband, and the ceremony was in no way concealed. 

In December, 1897, Tolson returned from America and the 
prisoner was prosecuted for bigamy. 

Held, the prisoner was not guilty of bigamy, as she had 
acted innocently in the honest belief that her husband was 
really dead. That in order to be guilty of a crime guilty 
intent must be proved, not necessarily to do the crime actually 
committed, but to do something wrong. 



PERSONAL CAPACITY TO COMMIT CRIME. 



A man is only excused for committing a Crime on the ground of 
Insanity if he does not know what he is doing or whether it 
is right or wrong. A person under a partial delusion must 
be considered in the same situation as to responsibility as if 
the facts in respect to which the delusion exists were real. 

DANIEL M'NAGHTEN'S CASE. [1843] 
(10 CI. &amp; F. 200 ; 8 Scott (N. E.) 595 ; 1 Car. &amp; K. 1,30.) 

The prisoner was charged with the murder of Edward 
Drummond, secretary to Sir Robert Peel, by shooting him on 
his way to Whitehall. 

The prisoner was acquitted on the ground that he was insane 
when he committed the crime. 

The verdict became the subject of a debate in the House of 



PERSONAL CAPACITY TO COMMIT CRIME. 309 

Lords, and on the opinion of the Judges being taken on the 
point they held as follows : — 

Notwithstanding a party accused did an act, which was 
in itself criminal, under the influence of insane delusion, 
with a view of redressing or revenging some supposed 
grievance or injury, or of producing some public benefit, he 
is nevertheless punishable if he knew at the time that he was 
acting contrary to law. 

That if the accused was conscious that the act was one 
which he ought not to do ; and if the act was at the same 
time contrary to law, he is punishable. In all cases of this 
kind the jurors ought to be told that every man is presumed 
to be sane, and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be 
responsible for his crimes, until the contrary be proved to 
their satisfaction ; and that to establish a defence on the 
ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that at the 
time of committing the act the party accused was labouring 
under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as 
not to knoiv the nature and quality of the act he was 
doing, or as not to know that what he was doing was wrong. 

That a party labouring under a partial delusion must be 
considered in the same situation as to responsibility , as if 
the facts in respect to which the delusion exists ivere real. 

That where an accused person is supposed to be insane, 
a medical man, who has been present in Court and heard 
the evidence, may be asked, as a matter of science, zvhether 
the facts stated by the witnesses, supposing them to be true, 
show a state of mind incapable of distinguishing behveen 
right and wrong. 



310 CRIMINAL LAW. 



HOMICIDE. 



The Killing of one of their number by Shipwrecked Sailors in 
extreme Necessity of Hunger does not excuse Murder. 

E. v. DUDLEY AND STEPHENS. [1884] 

(54 L. J. M. C. 32 ; 14 Q. B. D. 273, 560 ; 52 L. T. 107 ; 

33 W. E. 347 ; 15 Cox, C. C. 624 ; 49 J. P. 69— C. C. E.) 

The two prisoners were respectively master and mate of the 
Mignonette, which foundered on the high seas. The two 
prisoners and a boy, Richard Parker, escaped in an open boat 
and were exposed to the most terrible privations by lack of food. 
The boy Parker suffered the most, and as he lay at the bottom 
of the boat the two prisoners conceived the idea of killing and 
eating him in order to save their own lives. This they did, and 
it proved to be their salvation, for it was not till four days after 
the deed had been committed that they were rescued by a 
passing vessel. The boy was in a much weaker condition than 
the prisoners and was likely to have died before them, and if the 
prisoners had not killed the boy it was exceedingly improbable 
that the prisoners would have survived. 

Held) that the above fact did not excuse murder, and. 
that the prisoners were guilty of toilful murder. 



Homicide is excusable if a person takes away the Life of one 
person in Defence of the Life of himself or of another. 

E. v. EOSE. [1884] 
(15 Cox, 540.) 

The prisoner believed that his mother was about to be 
murdered by his father. His father held a knife in his hand, 



HOMICIDE. 311 

and the prisoner and his sisters were under the impression from 
the position their father was in that he was actually cutting 
their mother's throat. The father was a man of great strength — 
the prisoner, not desiring to take any risks of being worsted in 
an encounter, seized a gun and fired it in order to frighten his 
father. He at once fired a second shot, which lodged in his 
father's brain and from which he died. 

Lopes, J., in summing up, said : Homicide is excusable 
if a person takes away the life of another in defending him- 
self, if the fatal blow which takes away life is necessary for 
his preservation ; and that it is also excusable if the fatal 
blow inflicted ivas necessary for the preservation of the life 
of another. 

If the accused had reasonable ground for believing, and 
honestly believed, that his act was necessary for the defence 
of his mother, the homicide was justifiable. 

The jury found the prisoner not guilty. 



BURGLARY. 



To constitute Burglary the House broken into must be a 
Dwelling-house. 

R. v. MARTIN. [1806] 
(Eussel &amp; Ryan, 108.) 

The prisoner had broken open a house in the night and stolen 
drapery and hosiery goods to the value of several hundred 
pounds. 

The house was to all intents and purposes a complete 
dwelling-house, and had actually been fitted up as such by 
the prosecutor, who had meant to get married and live there 



312 CRIMINAL LAW. 

with his wife. He did not, however, get married, but continued 
to use the house and transacted his business in the shop and 
parlour, and dined and entertained his friends and passed the 
whole day there, considering it as his only home. There was a 
room over the shop which contained bedding, but was not 
fitted up as a bedroom, and the prosecutor never slept there, 
but used to sleep at the house of his mother, who lived a door or 
two away. 

Held j the above facts did not constitute the offence of 
burglary^ as the house was not a dwelling-house. 



Breaking out of a House may constitute the Crime of Burglary. 

E. v. M'KEAENEY. [1829] 
(Jebb, 99.) 

The prisoner was, about eleven o'clock at night, discovered in 
the cellar of a house hidden under a heap of potatoes ; he 
escaped into a room in the house and locked himself in. There 
was a sky-light in the room, which the prisoner broke and 
attempted to escape through. Davis, the owner of the house, 
heard the glass breaking and rushed round to the other side of 
the house in time to see the prisoner's head emerging through 
the sky-light. He dealt the prisoner a blow on the head with 
such force that he fell back into the room and was soon arrested 
by a constable, who broke in the door. The jury having found 
the prisoner guilty, the judge reserved for the twelve judges in 
the Irish Court of Crown Cases Eeserved the question as to 
whether the above facts constituted burglary. 

Held, the prisoner having got his head out of the sky- 
light it constituted a sufficient breaking out of the house to 
complete the crime of burglary . 



BURGLARY. 313 



The penetration of even a Finger is a sufficient entry to 
constitute Burglary. 

R. v. DAVIS. [1823] 
(Russel &amp; Ryan, 499.) 

The prisoner was tried on the charge of burglary in the 
dwelling-house of Montague Levy son. 

The prosecutor, who was standing in Pall Mall opposite his 
shop one evening, saw the prisoner, who was a small boy, 
standing by the window of the shop, which was part of the 
dwelling-house of the prosecutor, and observed the prisoner push 
his finger against a pane of glass in the corner of the window. 
The effect of this was to break the glass, and the prosecutor, 
standing in the position he did, saw the forepart of the prisoner's 
finger on the shop side of the glass. The jury found the 
prisoner guilty. 

Held, there was a sufficient entry to constitute burglary. 



FORGERY. 



The imitation of the Signature of the Painter on a copy of a 
Painting does not constitute Forgery, but may constitute a 
Cheat at common law. 

R. v. GLOSS. [1858] 

(27 L. J. M. C. 54 ; Dears. &amp; B. 460 ; 3 Jur. (N. S.) 1309 ; 
6 W. R. 109; 7 Cox, C. C. 494.) 

The prisoner, who was a picture dealer, was charged with the 
offence of procuring and having in his possession for the pur- 
poses of sale a certain painted copy of a picture on which 



314 CRIMINAL LAW. 

there " was unlawfully painted and forged the name of John 
Linnoll." 

He was also charged on another count with the offence of a 
common law cheat. 

The jury found him guilty on both counts. 

Held, by the Court of Crown Cases Reserved, that if a 
person knowingly sell as an original a copy of a picture 
ivith the painter } s name imitated upon it, and by means of 
the imitated name knowingly and fraudulently induce 
another to buy and pay for the picture as a genuine work 
of the artist, he may be indicted for a cheat at common law 
by means of a false token ; but he cannot be indicted for 
forging or uttering the forged name of the painter, for the 
crime of forgery must be committed with reference to some 
document or writing, and does not extend to the fraudulent 
inula I ion of a name put on a picture merely as a mark to 
identify it as the painter's work. 



Intent to Defraud is necessary to constitute all common law 
Forgeries and most statutory ones. 

E, v. HODGSON. [1856] 

(25 L. J. M. C. 78 ; Dears. &amp; B. 3 ; 2 Jur. (N. S.) 453 ; 4 W. E. 509 ; 
7 Cox, C. C. 122.) 

The prisoner was indicted at common law in 1856 for forging 
and uttering a diploma of the College of Surgeons. He had, it 
was proved, procured one actually issued by the College of 
Surgeons, erased the name of the person mentioned on it and 
substituted his own, changed the date, and made other alterations 
to make it appear to be a document issued by the College of 
Surgeons to him. 



FORGERY — LARCENY. 315 

Held, this did not constitute forgery, as no attempt to 
defraud had been proved. In order to constitute the offence 
of forgery at common law, an intent to defraud or do 
some specific wrong to an individual must be proved. 

Note. — The Medical Act (21 Vict. c. 90, s. 40), passed soon after 
this case, makes it a specific offence to falsely pretend to be a recog- 
nised medical practitioner, punishable by a fine not exceeding 20A 



LARCENY. 



A person cannot be guilty of Stealing that which is already his 

own. 

E. v. SMITH. [1852] 

(21 L. J. M. C. 1 1 1 ; 2 Den. C. C. 449 ; 16 Jur. 414 ; 5 Cox, 
C. C. 533.) 

The prisoner, professing to be about to pay the prosecutor 
some money which was due to him, produced a slip of paper 
impressed with a sixpenny receipt stamp, and put it down on 
the table before the prosecutor, and mentioned the amount for 
which the latter was to fill it up. After the prosecutor had 
written and signed a receipt for that sum, the prisoner took it 
up and went away with it without paying the money and in- 
tending to defraud the prosecutor. 

The jury found the prisoner guilty of larceny. 

Held j by the Court of Crown Cases Reserved, that 
the prisoner was not guilty of the offence of larceny, as 
the receipt did not belong to the prosecutor, but tvas 
merely handed to him for the purpose of writing his 
name upon it in the presence of the prisoner, consequently it 



31t&gt; CRIMINAL LAW. 

never was in the possession of the prosecutor independently 
of the -prisoner. It never was intended that the receipt 
should be the property of the prosecutor. If payment had 
been made it would have been delivered to the prisoner as 
his voucher. 



Taking an Article in the bona fide belief that it belongs to 
the taker is not Larceny. 

E. v. HALL. [1828] 
(3 Car. &amp; P. 409.) 

The prisoner was charged with robbing John Green, Lord 
Ducie's gamekeeper, of three hare-wires and a pheasant. The 
gamekeeper found three wires, in one of which a pheasant had 
been caught. These wires had been set by the prisoner, who, 
finding the gamekeeper had taken them, threatened to beat the 
gamekeeper's brains out if he did not hand them over. Fearing 
violence the gamekeeper did so. 

It was contended by the prosecution that, the wires and 
pheasant having been seized by the gamekeeper for the use of 
the lord of the manor, under 5 Anne, c. 14, s. 4, the prisoner 
had no property in them, and was therefore guilty. 

Per Vaughan, B., to the jury in summing up : If the 
prisoner acted on a bona tide impression that the wires 
and pheasant were his property, and that he was only 
getting back the possession of his own property, there was 
no animus furandi, and therefore no larceny. 

The jury found the prisoner not guilty. 



LARCENY. 317 



It is not Larceny to take an Article under a bona fide Claim of 
Right, e.g., where the taker has a lien over the Article he 
takes. 

R. v. WADE. [1869] 
(11 Cox, 549.) 

The prisoner, who was a travelling umbrella mender, asked 
the pros* cutor's wife if she had any umbrellas to mend. She 
told him she had one in need of repair, and he thereupon offered 
to do it cheaply for a few halfpence. Having repaired the 
umbrella and handed it back to the woman, who replaced it 
upstairs in her bedroom, he became more extravagant in his 
demands, and insisted on being paid the sum of 9r/. for the 
repairs. He contemptuously refused the '2d. she tendered him, 
rushed upstairs and seized the umbrella, which he took 
away. 

The prisoner, in his defence, denied that he intended to steal 
the umbrella, but merely took it to make sure that he was 
paid. 

Per Blackburn, J., to the jury in summing up: The 
prisoner had a right to keep the umbrella until he had been 
paid for the trouble he had been put to in repairing it. If 
he had honestly claimed his right when he removed the 
umbrella from the house, he was not guilty of larceny ; but 
if on the other hand, it was a mere colourable pretence to 
obtain possession, then it ivould be larceny. It did not 
matter whether anything was due to him if, at the time 
he took it, he honestly intended to hold it as a security 
for his alleged lien. 

The jury found the prisoner not guilty. 



318 CRIMINAL LAW. 

A Wife cannot as a rule be guilty of Stealing the Goods of her 
Husband ; but where a Wife, guilty of Adultery, gives his 
Goods to her Paramour, the latter is guilty of Larceny. 

E. v. FEATHEESTONE. [1854] 

(23 L. J. M. C. 127 ; Dears. C. C. 369 ; 2 C. L. E. 774 ; 18 Jur. 538 ; 

2 W. E. 496 ; 6 Cox, 376.) 

The prosecutor's wife left his house, taking with her some of 
her husband's money, and saying to the prisoner, who was in a 
room below, " It is all right ; come on." The prisoner left in a 
few minutes, joined the prosecutor's wife, and slept with her at 
a public-house the same night. The prisoner when taken into 
custody was found to have the prosecutor's money upon him. 
On the trial of the prisoner for stealing the prosecutor's money, 
the jury found him guilty, stating that he received the money 
from the wife knowing that she took it without the authority of 
her husband. 

Held, that the conviction was proper. 

The general rule is that a wife cannot be convicted of 
larceny for stealing the goods of her husband. It is no 
larceny in the wife to carry away her husband'' s goods, as 
husband and ivife are one person in the eye of the law. But 
the law has properly qualified that general rule by saying 
that, if a wife commit adultery and then steal the goods of 
her husband with the adulterer, she has determined her 
quality of wife, and is no longer looked upon as having any 
property in the goods, and the person who assists her is 
guilty of larceny, and his case is looked upon in the same 
light as if he had taken the goods himself. 

By sects. 12 and 16 of the M. W. P. A., 1882, the eloping wife 
may herself also be convicted of larceny in the above circumstances. 



LARCENY. 319 



To constitute a Larceny by a Bailee some act of Conversion quite 
inconsistent with the Bailment must be proved. 

E. v. JACKSON. [1864] 
(9 Cox, C. C. 505.) 

The prisoner, who was a lodger of the prosecutor, borrowed a 
coat from the prosecutor for a day. A few days later he again 
borrowed the coat, but this time without the permission of the 
prosecutor. The prosecutor, who met him with it on, however, 
allowed him to continue wearing it that day. A day or two 
later he left town, and was subsequently found on board a boat 
bound for Australia wearing the coat. 

Held, per Martin, B., who ivas trying the case, that 
there was -no evidence of conversion to satisfy the statute ; 
to bring a case within the statute the determination of the 
bailment must be something analogous to larceny, and some 
act must be done inconsistent with the purposes of the 
bailment. 



In order to constitute Larceny the Ownership in another of the 
Article taken must be antecedent to the taking and not 
created thereby. There is no property in Animals ferae 
naturae unless reduced into Possession, and they cannot 
therefore be Stolen. 

E. v. TOWNLEY. [1871] 
(40 L. J. M.C. 144; L.E. ICC. 315; 24 L. T. 517 ; 19 W. E. 725 ; 

12 Cox, 59.) 

Poachers killed some rabbits on Crown land, put some of 
them in bags and some in bundles, strapped them together by 
the legs, and concealed them in a ditch on the same laud as a 
place of deposit till they could conveniently remove them. All 



320 CRIMINAL LAW. 

this took place before eight o'clock in the morning. The 
prisoner, one of the poachers, then departed, and at about a 
quarter to eleven o'clock on the same day returned with two 
other men to the ditch and began to remove the rabbits. The 
prisoner knew of the manner in which the rabbits had been 
killed. It was taken as a fact that the poachers had no intention 
to abandon the wrongful possession of the rabbits. 

Held, that the above facts did not constitute larceny, as 
the rabbits, when alive, were animals ferae naturae, not 
the subject of property. 

That although when killed, whether by licensees or tres- 
passers, a wild animal becomes the property of the owner of 
the soil, yet at the same time that fact does not entitle the 
owner to maintain an indictment for larceny against the 
person who kills it and picks it up ; in order to support an 
indictment for larceny in cases of that kind there must be a 
decided severance between the act of killing and the act of 
taking aivay. In this case, however, the killing and placing 
the rabbits in the ditch and subsequently removing them con- 
stituted one inseverable act of talcing and carrying away, 
and therefore there was no larceny. 



The Finder of an Article is not guilty of Larceny where he 
reasonably believes the true owner cannot be found, even 
though after subsequently ascertaining who the true owner 
is he converts it and appropriates its proceeds. 

R. ». THUEBORN. [1849] 

(18 L. J. M. C. 140 ; 1 Den. C. C. 387 ; T. &amp; M. 67 ; 

2 Car. &amp; K. 831 ; 13 Jur. 499.) 

The prisoner was indicted for stealing a bank note. It 
appeared that he had picked it up on the road, and that he 



LARCENY. :V2l 

meant to appropriate it to his own use, but he had not then any 
means of ascertaining the owner or any reason to believe that 
the owner knew where to find it. He afterwards was informed 
who the owner was, but notwithstanding this he changed it and 
appropriated the money. The jury found that he had reason 
to believe it to be the prosecutor's property before he changed it. 

Held, that he was not guilty of larceny. 

If a man finch goods that are actually lost, or are 
reasonably supposed, by him to have been lost, and appro- 
priates them with intent to take the entire dominion over 
them, really believing, when he takes them, that the owner 
cannot be found, it is not larceny. Nor is it larceny if, 
after having so taken them, he obtains knowledge of the 
ownership, and then appropriates them to his own use. 
The wrong/id intention must exist at the time of the 
taking, for though the possession ivas accompanied by a 
dishonest intent, it was still a lawful possession, and good 
against all but the real owner, and the subsequent conversion 
was not therefore a trespass in this case and consequently 
no larceny. 

If, however, the finder who takes goods so lost, or 
supposed to be lost, has reason to believe, at the time of 
taking, that the oivner can be found, it is larceny.

To constitute the offence of receiving Goods knowing them to 
have been stolen, the Receiver must at the time he received 
them have had a Guilty Knowledge. 

R. v. WOODWARD. [1864] 

(L. &amp; C. 122.) 

The thief of certain goods delivered them to the prisoner's 
wife in the absence of her husband, and she paid him 6c?. on 
account. Afterwards the prisoner met the thief, and with a guilty 
knowledge agreed with him for the price, and paid the balance. 

The prisoner was indicted with having received stolen goods 
knowing them to have been stolen. It was contended on his 
behalf that the guilty knowledge must exist at the time of 
receiving, and that this was the time of the delivery to the wife ; 
and that, when the wife received the stolen property, guilty 
knowledge could not have come to the mind of the prisoner. 
The jury found the prisoner guilty. 

Held, the conviction was right, as although there tvas no 
guilty knowledge in the prisoner at the time his tvife received 
the goods, get, as soon as he met the thief, having acquired 
a guilty knowledge, he approved of and ratified the receipt, 
and this would &lt;nia&gt;unt to a receipt with a guilty know- 
ledge. 



EMBEZZLEMENT. 323 

The Possessor of Goods recently stolen is presumed to be either 
the Person who stole them or the Receiver, with guilty 
knowledge, according to the circumstances of the case. 

R. v. LANGMEAD. [1864] 
(L. &amp; C. 427 ; 10 L. T. 350 ; 9 Cox, C. C. 464.) 

The prisoner was indicted on one count with having stolen 
certain sheep, and on another with having received the same, 
well knowing them to have been stolen. 

The sheep which had been recently stolen were found to be 
in the possession of the prisoner, who could give no reasonable 
account as to how they came into his possession. 

The prisoner was found by the jury to have been guilty on 
both counts. 

Held, the prisoner teas rightly convicted, for the possession 
of property recently stolen is evidence that the person in 
possession either stole the property or received it, knowing it 
to be stolen, according to the other circumstances of the 
case. 



EMBEZZLEMENT. 



To constitute the offence of Embezzlement, the offender must be a 
Clerk or Servant of Person whose Money is embezzled. 
Such employment may be of the slightest nature. 

R. v. FOULKES. [1875] 

(44 L. J. M. 0. 65 ; L. R, 2 C. C. 150 ; 32 L. T. 407 ; 23 W. R. 696 ; 

13 Cox, C. C. 63.) 

The son of a man who kept an office and held various appoint- 
ments, amongst which was that of clerk to a local board, lived 
at home and assisted his father in his office in conducting the 
business of the board, but without being paid any salary, was 

v2 



32 1 CRIMINAL LAW. 

found guilty by the jury of embezzling the money received by 
his father on business of the local board while being employed 
in the capacity of clerk or servant to his father. 

Held, that the prisoner had been rightly convicted, as 
although no binding contract existed ivhich could have been 
enforced against the son, yet the employment may exist at 
ivill, and need not necessarily be for a greater length of 
time, and there was sufficient evidence that the prisoner tvas 
the clerk or servant of his father, and had received money 
on account of his master ivhich he had embezzled. 



FALSE PRETENCES. 

To constitute the offence of Obtaining Money by False Pretences 
there must be a false pretence of some existing fact and not 
merely of some future event. 

E. v. LEE. [1863] 
(L. &amp; C. 309 ; 8 L. T. 437 ; 11 W. E. 761 ; 9 Cox, C. C. 304.) 

The prisoner obtained money by pretending that he had got 
to pay his rent on the following Monday, while in fact he had 
no intention of paying it, but meant to appropriate the money 
to his own purposes. The prisoner was indicted for obtaining 
money by false pretences. The jury found the prisoner guilty 
on the ground that the prisoner's statement that he was going 
to pay his rent on the Monday was a false pretence and that the 
money was advanced on the credit of that false pretence. 

Held, that the finding of the jury did not warrant a con- 
viction, for in order to sustain an indictment for obtaining 
money by false pretences, there must be a false pretence of 
some existing fact. 



FALSE PRETENCES. 325 

A False Representation may be by Silent Conduct. 

E. r. BARNARD. [1837] 
(7 Car. &amp; P. 784.) 

The prisoner, who was not a member of the University, went 
to the shop of a Mr. Vincent in the High Street, Oxford, in a 
commoner's cap and gown, and ordered certain tilings, which 
were supplied to him. He stated that he belonged to Magdalen 
College. 

Held, even if nothing had passed in words, the fact of 
the prisoner appearing in the cap and gown would be preg- 
nant evidence from which a jury should infer that he 
pretended he was a member of the University, and, if so, 
would have been a sufficient false pretence to satisfy the 
statute. 

The jury found the prisoner guilty. 



False Pretences may be by Implication. 

E. v. COOPER, [1877] 

(46 L. J. M. C. 219 ; 2 Q. B. D. 510 ; 36 L. T. 671 ; 25 W. E. 696 ; 
13 Cox, C. C. 617.) 

A prisoner was convicted upon an indictment which charged 
him with obtaining eight tons of potatoes by falsely pretending 
that he was a dealer in potatoes, and in a large way of business, 
and in a position to do a good trade in potatoes, and was able 
to pay for large quantities of potatoes as and when the same 
might be delivered to him. The only evidence was the follow- 
ing letter from the prisoner to the prosecutor: — 

" Dear Sir — Please send me one truck of Regents and one 
truck of Rock as samples, at your prices named in your letter. 
Let them be good cpaality, then I am sure a good trade will be 



326 CRIMINAL LAW. 

done for both of us. I will remit you the cash on arrival of 
goods and invoice. — Yours truly, 

" William Cooper. 

" P.S. — I may say if you use me well I shall be a good 
customer. An answer will oblige, saying when they are put on." 

The jury found the prisoner guilty of obtaining the potatoes 
by false pretences. 

Held \ false pretences may be made by the use of ambiguous 
words, if tJtose words arc naturally and reasonably capable 
of conveying them, and as the words used in the letter might 
naturally and reasonably convey to the mind of the prose- 
cutor the false pretences alleged in the indictment ; and a 
jury, having found that such false pretences were so made 
by the letter, the conviction was rigid. 



By drawing a Cheque the Drawer impliedly represents that the 
Cheque is a good and valid Order for the amount inserted in 
it. A Drawer of a Cheque in payment for Goods where there 
are no Funds to meet it may be liable for obtaining Goods 
by False Pretences. 

R. v. IIAZELTON. [1874] 

(44 L. J. M. C. 11; L. E. 2 C. C. 134 ; 31 L. T. 431 ; 23 W. R. 139 ; 
13 Cox, C. C. 1.) 

The prisoner, having no funds at his bank, drew a cheque for 
certain goods he bought on a ready- money transaction. He 
had no authority to overdraw his banking account. On being 
tried for obtaining goods by false pretences the jury found the 
prisoner guilt}". 

//'■A/, a nmn wlio makes and gives a cheque for the 
amount of goods purchased in a ready-money transaction, 



FALSE PEETENCES. 327 

saying that he toishes to pay ready money, makes a repre- 
sentation that the cheque is a good and valid order for the 
amount inserted in it, and if such person has only a colour- 
able account at the bank on which the cheque is drawn 
without available assets to meet it, and has no authority to 
overdraw, and knoivs that the cheque will be dishonoured on 
presentation, and intends to defraud, he may be convicted of 
obtaining such goods by false pretences. 



The Offence of obtaining Money by False Pretences is not com- 
mitted if the False Pretence does not induce a Person to 
part with the Money. 

E. v. MILLS. [1857] 

(26 L. J. M. C. 79 ; Dears. &amp; B. 205 ; 3 Jur. (N. S.) 447 ; 5 W. R. 
528 ; 7 Cox, C. C. 263.) 

The prisoner, who was employed to work for the prosecutor, 
stated that he had done more work than was the fact, and 
requested payment for the work he professed to have done. 
The prosecutor, though lie was aware of the true amount of 
work the prisoner had done, and that he was makiug a know- 
ingly false overcharge, paid him what he asked. 

Held, that the prisoner could not be indicted for obtaining 
the money by false pretences as the false pretence did not 
have the effect of inducing the prosecutor to part with the 
money. 



1328 CRIMINAL LAW. 

The difference between the crime of False Pretences and that of 
Larceny depends 0.1 whether the Owner intends to part 
with the Property to the Person taking it. If he does 
the offence is False Pretences ; if he does not it is Larceny. 

E. v. BAENES. [1850] 

(20 L. J. M. C. 34 ; 2 Den. 59 ; T. &amp; M. 387; 11 Jur. 1123; 

5 Cox, 112.) 

It was the duty of the prisoner, who was a servant of the 
prosecutors, in the absence of their chief clerk, to purchase and 
pay for, on behalf of his masters, any kitchen stuff brought to 
their premises for sale. On one occasion he falsely stated to the 
chief clerk that he had paid 2s. 3d. for kitchen stuff which he 
had bought for his masters, and demanded to be paid for it. 
The clerk on this paid him 2s. 3d. out of money which his 
masters had furnished him with to pay for the kitchen stuff. 
The prisoner applied the money to his own use. 

Helt/, that as the clerk had delivered the money to the 
prisoner with the intention of parting with it altogether, the 
prisoner was not liable to an indictment for stealing the 
money, but that he might have been indicted for obtaining it 
by false pretences.

The offence of Bigamy is committed even though the Second 
Marriage is not valid on grounds other than that of the Bigamy. 

1.'. v. ALLEN. [187-2] 

(-11 L. J. M. C D7 : L. R. 1 C. C. 367 ; 26 L. T. 664; 20 AW E. 7.56 ; 

12 Cox, C. C. 193.) 

The prisoner, who was indicted for bigamy, married his first 
wife, Sarah Cunningham, who died in L866, leaviug a niece 
named Harriet Crouch. 



BLASPHEMOUS LI15EL. 329 

In the year 1S07 he married his second wife, Ann Gntteridge, 
Tiring of her, he went through the form of marriage with his 
first wife's niece, Harriet Crouch. 

Such a marriage, coming withiu the prohibited degrees of 
affinity, was null and void to all intents and purposes what- 
soever by 5 &amp; b' Will. IV. c. o4, s. 2. 

Held , that bigamy had been committed by the prisoner, as 
the validity of the second marriage did not affect the 
question, and that the offence vjas committed when the 
prisoner went through the form and ceremony of marriage 
with Harriet Crouch. 



BLASPHEMOUS LIBEL. 

Honest denial of the Christian Religion does not constitute a 
blasphemous Libel. There must be a wilful intention to 
insult and mislead others by means of licentious and contu- 
melious Abuse applied to sacred subjects or by wilful mis- 
representations. 

E. v. EAMSAY AND FOOTE. [1883] 

(48 L. T. 733 ; 1 Cab. &amp; E. 126 ; 15 Cox, C. C. 231.) 

The defendants were charged with the publication of a blas- 
phemous libel by means of the publication of certain cartoons in 
a newspaper called " The Freethinker." 

Coleridge, L. C. J., directed the jury that an honest 
denial of the truth of Christianity does not constitute a 
blasphemous libel. The criterion and test of guilt is whether 
there is a wilful intention to pervert, insult, and mislead 
others by means of licentious and contumelious abuse applied 
to sacred subjects, or by wilfid misrepresentations or artful 
sophistry calculated to mislead the ignorant and unwary. 



:;:;&lt;) criminal law. 



RIOT AND UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY. 



Where persons assemble together for a purpose which, if 
executed, would constitute Riot, yet separate without having 
executed it, they are only guilty of Unlawful Assembly. 

R. v. BIRT AND OTHERS. [1831] 
(5 Car. &amp; P. 154.) 

The prisoners were indicted for riot on one count and on 
another for unlawful assembly. The prisoners assembled for the 
purpose of breaking down the fences of the enclosure of the 
Forest of Dean, and destroyed more than a mile of the fences. 

Held f per Pattewn, J., the difference between a riot and 
an unlawful assembly is this : If the parties assemble in a 
tumultuous manner and actually execute their purpose with 
violence, it is a riot ; but if they merely meet upon a pur- 
pose which, if executed, would make them rioters, and, 
having done nothing, they separate without carrying their 
purpose into effect, it is an unlawful assembly. 
Verdict — guilty. 



PUOVIN'CK OF JUDGE AND JUKY. 331 



EVIDENCE. 



PROVINCE OF JUDGE AND JURY 



The function of the Jury is to decide on the Facts, subject to 
this, that it is for the Judge to decide whether there is any 
Evidence on which the Jury could reasonably act. Questions 
of Law are for the Judge. 
METROPOLITAN RAILWAY CO. v.. JACKSON. [1877] 
(47 L. J. C. P. 303; 3 App. Cas. 103; 37 L. T. 670; 
26 W. R. 175— H.L.) 

While Jackson was travelling on the Metropolitan railway in 
a carriage, all the seats of which were occupied, three more 
persons got in and remained standing until the train arrived at 
the next station, where there was a crowd of persons, some of 
whom tried to enter the carriage just as the train was starting ; 
Jackson rose from his seat and tried to prevent more passengers 
from getting in ; after the traiu had started Jackson fell 
forward and put his hand on one of the hinges of the door to 
save himself ; at the same moment a porter pushed away the 
persons who were trying to get in and slammed the door, 
crushing Jackson's thumb. Jackson brought an action to 
recover damages for the injury so caused. 

The action was tried before Brett, J., and a special jury. 
The learned judge ruled that there was evidence of negligence 
for the jury, who found a verdict for Jackson with 50/. 
damages. 

Held, by the House of Lords reversing the decision of the 
Court of Appeal, that there was no evidence of negligence 
proper to be left to the jury. 

In actions for negligence the rule is that from any given 
state of facts the judge must say whether negligence can 



332 EVIDENCE. 

reasonably be inferred, and the jury must say whether it 
ought to be inferred. 

It is of the greatest importance in the administration of 
justice that those separate fuur-lions should be maintained 
distinct. It would be a serious inroad on the province of a 
jury if in a case ivhcre there are facts from which negligence 
may reasonably be inferred, the juelge were to withdraw the 
case from the jury upon the ground that in his opinion negli- 
gence ought not to be inferred ; and it would, on the other 
hand, place in the hands of the jury a power which might be 
exercised in the most arbitrary manner if they were at liberty 
to hold that negligence might be inferred from any state of 
facts ivhatcver. To take the instance of actions against 
railway companies, a, company might be unpopular, un- 
punctual anil irregular in its service, badly equipped as to 
its staff, unaccommodating to the public, notorious perhaps 
for accidents occurring on the line, and ivhcn an action was 
brought for the consequences of an accident, a jury if left to 
themselves might upon evidence of general carelessness find 
a verdict against evidence. 



The Admissibility of Evidence is for the Judge ; the Facts upon 
which that Admissibility depends are to be determined by 
him and not by the Jury. 

BAETLETT v. SMITH. [1842] 
(12 L. J. Ex. 287 ; 7 Jur. 44 S ; 1 1 M. &amp; W. 483 ; 63 E. E. 664.) 

In an action by the indorsee of a lull of exchange against the 
drawer, the declaration stated that the defendants made their 
bill of exchange and directed it to Mr. John Butcher, Dublin 
(payable in London), and thereby required the said J. E. 
Lutcher to pay to the order of the defendants the sum of 17/. 



PROVINCE OF JUDGE AND JURY. 333 

At the trial before the under-Sheriff of Middlesex the de- 
fendants objected to the bill being read on the suggestion that, 
although the bill purported to be drawn in Ireland, it was in 
fact drawn in London, and being merely an inland bill required 
a 2s. stamp, instead of the foreign bill stamp of Is. 67/., and they 
tendered evidence to prove that the bill was drawn in London. 
The under-sheriff refused the evidence at that stage of the case, 
and allcwed the bill to be read. The defendants afterwards, as 
part of their case, gave evidence of the bill having been drawn 
in London, whereupon the under-sheriff left it to the jury to say 
whether the bill had been drawn in this country or in Ireland. 
The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff. 

Held., by the Exchequer Chamber, the under-sheriff having 
refused the evidence that was tendered by the defendants, 
there must be a rule absolute for a neiv trial. 

All facts which are necessary to be proved, ivith a view to 
the reception of evidence, are for the consideration of the 
judge, and he is to receive evidence respecting them for his 
own satisfaction. He might, indeed, if he pleased, ask the 
opinion of the jury , but still the decision ought to be his oivn. 
A judge should receive evidence as to the competency of a 
witness or the sufficiency of a stamp, which is good upon the 
face of it, and ought to determine those questions for himself 
instead of submitting them to the jury. In the present case 
the under-sheriff was wrong in alloiving the bill to be read 
in the first instance, and in afterwards submitting to the 
jury evidence as to its admissibility. He ought to have 
admitted the evidence at the time it wets tendered, and have 
determined upon its effect at that time. 

This is one of the many cases in which a judge ought to 
receive evidence for his oivn satisfaction, and ought not to 
submit it to the jury. 



334 EVIDENCE. 

The construction of written Documents is for the Court ; if they 
be explained by extrinsic facts they are for the consideration 
of the Jury. 

MORRELL v. FRITH. [1838] 
(7 L. J. Ex. 172 ; 3 M. &amp; W. 402 ; 49 R, R. 659.) 

At the trial of this action before Gurney, B., and a jury, it 
appeared the defendant was indebted to the plaintiffs, who 
were bankers at Oxford, in a sura of 479/., which had been due 
for more than six years. The plaintiffs relied on the following 
letter, written by the defendant to the plaintiffs' solicitor, as a 
sufficient acknowledgment of the debt to take the case out of 
the Statute of Limitations : — 

"28th July, 1837. 
" Sir — Since the receipt of your letter (and, indeed, for some 
time previously) I have been in almost daily expectation of 
being enabled to give a satisfactory reply to your first applica- 
tion respecting the demand of Messrs. Morrell against mo. I 
propose being in Oxford to-morrow morning, when I will call 
upon you on the matter. 

" I am, Sir, &amp;c, 

" W. C. Frith." 

The learned judge was of the opinion that the letter was not 
sufficient to take the case out of the Statute of Limitations, and 
although requested by the plaintiffs' counsel to leave that 
question to the jury, lie declined to do so, and directed a non- 
suit. 

Held, on appeal, by the Court of Exchequer, that (he 
appeal mubt fail. This teller contained not/tine/ that could 
be construed into an acknowledgment of the dell ; I he utmost 
that could be -made of it was that it was evasively worded 
so as to avoid any direct acknowledgment Then the next 
question was whether it ought /&lt;&gt; hare hern lift to the jury. 
One case in ivhich the effect of a written document must be

left to a jury is where it requires parol evidence to explain 
it, as in the ordinary case of mercantile contracts, in which 
peculiar terms and abbreviations arc employed. So., also, 
where a series of letters form part of the evidence in the 
cause they must be left, tvith the rest of it, to the jury. 
But where the question arises on the construction of one 
document only, without reference to any extrinsic evidence 
to explain it, it is the safest course to adhere to the ride, 
that the construction of written documents is a question of 
laiv for the Court. The intention of the parties is a question 
for the jury, and in some cases, in case of 'libel, for instance, 
the meaning of the document is part of that intention, and, 
therefore, must be submitted to the jury. But where a legal 
right is to be determined from the construction of a written 
document which either is unambiguous, or of which the 
ambiguity arises only from the words themselves, that is a 
question to be decided by the judge. 



RELEVANCY TO TEE ISSUE. 



Anything said or done by Conspirators in execution or further- 
ance of the common object, but not otherwise, is admissible 
in Evidence. 

R. v. BLAKE. [1844] 

(13 L. J. M. C. 131 ; 8 Jur. 667 ; 6 Q. B. 126 ; 66 E. R. 311.) 

Blake and Tye were indicted for conspiring to cause goods 
which had been imported to be carried away from port without 
payment of revenue duties. 

Upon the trial Blake only was present, Tye, the other 
defendant, having absconded. It was proved to be the duty of 



336 EVIDENCE. 

Tye, as agent of the importer, to make certain entries called 
" sight entries,'' upon which entries warrants would be granted 
for the examination of the goods hy Blake, whose duty it would 
be to enter the actual contents of the ca^es in a book called 
the " Blue Book," the examination being made in the presence 
of Tye, who would thus also become aware of the actual 
contents, and should make therefrom what is called " a perfect 
entry " and transmit it to Blake, whose duty it would be to 
compare it with the " Blue Book," and if the "perfect entry " 
and "Blue Book" corresponded to write the word " correct " 
across the " perfect entry," when upon payment of the duty 
thus ascertained the goods would be delivered. 

Evidence was given of thirteen different transactions of 
passing goods through the Custom House in which both Blake 
and Tye had been concerned, the " sight entries " and " perfect 
entries " in all of them being proved to be in the handwriting 
of Tye and the entries in the " Blue Book," with the word 
" correct " written across the " perfect entries " being proved to 
be in the handwriting of Blake. All the entries were proved to 
bo false. 

The prosecution put in evidence against Blake (1) a day-book 
of Tye containing entries in his handwriting relative to the 
thirteen several transactions and showing the amount of duties 
actually paid as the importer's agent, and (2) the counterfoil of 
Tye's bank cheque-book, which purported to show that part of 
the moneys of which the Customs had been defrauded in these 
transactions had been paid to Blake. 

Held, by the Court of Common Pleas, on an application for 
a new trial, that on a trial for conspiracy il is an admitted 
principle that evidence of acts or declarations bij one of the 
conspirators is not receivable against another conspirator 
unless the acts or declarations tend to the advancement of 
the common object. That assumes lite object not to be then 
completed. If it had been accomplished, the act or state- 
ment is not receivable, 



RELEVANCY TO THE ISSUE. 337 

The day-book was admissible on this principle, bat the 
counter/oil ivas not, for the entry therein ivas no act done 
in pursuance of the conspiracy, so as to make the entry 
evidence against Blake, and ivas no more than a declaration 
or statement by a co -conspirator to a third party as to the 
result of the conspiracy. 

The rule for a new trial ivas accordingly made absolute. 



Evidence may be given of Motive, preparation for a Crime, and 
subsequent conduct of a Prisoner. 

E. r. PALMER, [1856] 
(Stephen, History of Criminal Law, III. 389.) 

Lord Campbell in his charge to the jury told them that in a 
case of that sort it was impossible to obtain direct evidence of 
the mixing up or administration of the poisons. Only circum- 
stantial evidence could be reasonably expected, and it was of 
great importance to ascertain if there was any motive, however 
inadequate, for the crime. 

It was also necessary to bear in mind the fact that according 
to the witnesses for the prosecution the prisoner had procured 
the very poison used, and it was for the jury to ask themselves 
for what purpose it was obtained. 

It was necessary to pay attention to the conduct of the 
prisoner subsequent to the murder — how eager he was to have 
the coffin nailed down ; how he tried to bribe a postboy to 
upset the cart containing a jar which was to be analysed in 
search of poison ; how he tampered with a postmaster, and ob- 
tained a letter from a Dr. Taylor who had analysed the contents 
of the jar ; and how he had done his best to tamper with the 
coroner's jury to induce them to give a verdict which would 
amount to an acquittal. 

The prisoner was found guilty, sentenced to death, and 
hanged.

388 EVIDENCE. 

A Statement to be adnrssible as part of the res gestae must have 
been made by the Deceased at the time of the acts complained 
of. A Dying Declaration, which is only admissible in cases 
of Homicide, must be made by Declarant in belief that he is 
dying. 

R. v. BED1NGFIELD. [1879] 

(14 Cox, C. C. 311.) 

The prisoner was charged with the murder of a woman at 
Ipswich. The deceased, with her throat cut, had rushed out of 
a room in which she left the prisoner, whose throat was also cut. 
On meeting one of the witnesses she said something and 
pointed to the house. A few minutes later she died. The 
prisoner's defence was that the deceased had first cut his throat 
and then her own. 

Held, that the statement was not admissible as a dying 
declaration, as the deceased did not appear to be aware that 
she was dying, nor as part of the res gestae, for it was not 
part of anything done, or something said while something 

was being done. Anything uttered by the deceased at the 
time the act tvas being done would be admissible, as, for 
instance, if she had been heard to sag something as u Dorft, 
Harry!" But here it tvas something stated by her after 
it tvas all over, whatever it was, and after the act tvas 
completed. 

Note.— In the case of R. v. Jenkins (1869), 1 0. C. E. 187, 
a statement was made by the deceased and taken down in 
writing. The deceased then said : "I make the above statement 
with the fear of death before me, and with no hope at present of 
my recovery." Thirteen hours later the deponent died. 

Held, the statement was not admissible. 



RELEVANCY TO THE ISSUE. 339 

In cases of Indecent Assault only, statements by way of complaint 
made by Prosecutrix, in absence of Prisoner, are admissible 
as Corroboration of Prosecutrix's credibility if made at the 
first opportunity. 

R. v. OSBORNE. [1905] 

(74 L. J. K. B. 31 1 ; (1905) 1 K. B. 551 ; 92 L. T. 393 ; 
53 W. E. 494; 09 J. P. 189.) 

The prisoner was charged with indecently assaulting a girl 
twelve years of age. Evidence was admitted as to what the 
girl said when she was met by some girl friends as she was 
running away from the prisoner's shop where the assault had 
taken place. The prisoner was convicted, but sentence was 
postponed pending the decision of the Court for Crown Cases 
Reserved as to whether this evidence was admissible. 

Held, by that Court, that the prisoner teas rightly con- 
victed, as the evidence was admissible. 

In support of a charge of rape or an offence of a similar 
class, hut only in such cases a statement in the nature of a 
complaint made by the prosecutrix to a third person, not in 
the presence of the accused, may be given in evidence, whether 
proof of non-consent is or is not a material element in the 
charge under investigation, provided such statement is shown 
to have been made at the first opportunity which reasonably 
offered itself after the commission of the offence, and has 
not been elicited by questions of a leading and inducing or 
intimidating character. The judge ought, however, to inform 
the jury that the statement is not evidence oj the facts com- 
plained of, and must not be regarded by them, if believed, 
as other than corroboration of the prosecutrix 1 s credibility, 
and, where consent is in issue, of the absence of consent. 

Where the statement has been made in answer to a 
question — and the fact that it has been so made docs not of 
itself render it inadmissible as a complaint — it is for the 

z2 



- i t&lt;&gt; EVIDENCE. 



judge in each case to determine whether the character of the 
question put, as well as other circumstances, such as the 
relationship of the prosecutrix, is such as to render the

Evidence of Offences similar but subsequent to the Charge may be 
given to show connected Scheme of Fraud. Judge has a 
Discretion to comment on Prisoner's Failure to give Evidence 
at trial. 

EEGINA v. EHODES. [1899] 

(68 L. J. Q. B. 83 ; L. E. (1899) 1 Q. B. 77 ; 79 L. T. 360 ; 4 7 
W. E. 121 ; 62 J. P. 774 ; 19 Cox, C. C. 182.) 

The prisoner was indicted for obtaining goods by false pre- 
tences. At the trial at Quarter Sessions evidence was given of 
several other cases where he had obtained goods in the same 
way, although he was not charged with those offences. In 
summing up to the jury, the Chairman commented upon the 
prisoner's failure to give evidence at the trial. 

Held, hi/ the Court for Crown Case* Reserved, that where 
on the trial of an indictment for obtaining goods by false 
'pretences there is evidence that at dates subsequent to the 
offence charged the prisoner obtained goods from other 
persons by similar false pretences, such evidence is admissible 
when it points directly to one and the same system of fraud 
ami a connected scheme of dishonesty. 

A Judge at the trad has the rigid to comment on a 
prisoner's fa Hare to give evidence on Ids own behalf under 
the Criminal Evidence Act, 1898; but the right of com- 
ment rests solely on the judge's discretion, ami its exercise 
depends agon the circumstances of each particular ease, (aid 
is one as to which no general ride can be laid down. 

Note. — Counsel may not comment on the prisoner's failure to 
give evidence at trial. 



FACTS SHOWING SYSTEM. :}41 

The Declaration of a Deceased Person is admissible where made 
in the usual course of business and where it was the duty of 
the deceased to make the whole of it. A letter posted in 
the ordinary course of business is presumed to have been 
duly received. Secondary Evidence of its Contents may be 
given where not produced after notice. 

TEOTTER v. MACLEAN. [1879] 
(13 Ch. D. 574; 42 L. T. 118; 28 W. R. 244.) 

In this action it was sought to put in evidence an entry in a 
diary kept by an agent who had since died in order to prove a 
certain interview which was alleged to have taken place between 
the parties. 

Held, by Fry, J., that the entry, in order to be admissible 
as a dying declaration, must have been made by the deceased 
in the usual routine of business, and it must be proved that 
it ivas his duty to make the whole of it. The evidence must 
be rejected, as it was not proved that it ivas any part of 
the agent's duty to make the ivhole of it. 

The original of a letter written by the defendant to the 
plaintiff, of which notice to produce had been given, was 
declared by the plaintiff never to have been received by him. 

A witness for the defendant produced a copy of this letter, 
which he said had been made at the time, and although he did 
not remember having posted it, he had no doubt that that was 
done in the usual course of business. 

The plaintiff objected to the admission of this copy, as he 
had no such letter in his possession, and he contended it ought 
to be strictly proved. 

Held, per Fry, J. : " It appears to me that there is 
some evidence of the posting of the letter, though it is weak. 
The witness says that in the ordinary course of business he 
would post the letter. I must therefore admit the copy? 1

Hearsay Evidence is not generally admissible. 

STOBAET v. DEYDEN. [1836] 

(5 L. J. Ex. 218 ; 1 M. &amp; W. 615 ; 2 Gale, 146 ; 1 Tyr. &amp; Gr. 899 ; 

46 E. E. 424.) 

This was an action on a covenant in a mortgage deed to 
which there was a plea of non erf factum. A man named 
M'Cree, who on the face of the instrument appeared to be the 
subscribing witness, being dead, the execution of the deed was 
proved in the usual way by proof of his handwriting. Mr. 
Cresswell, a witness for the defendant, offered in evidence 
declarations of M'Cree of facts tending to prove that the deed 
was a forgery. At the trial this evidence was rejected. 

Held, on appeal, by the Court of Exchequer Pleas, that 
the evidence ivas properly rejected. 

The (jenered rule is that hearsay evidence is not admissible 
as a proof of a fact which has been stated by a third per son. 
There "re certain exceptions to this rule, based on con- 
venience or necessity, but this case docs not constitute an 
exception to that rule. 

If any declarations at any time from the mouth of sub- 
scribing witnesses who are dead arc to be admit led in evidence 
the result would be thai the security of solemn instruments 
vould be much impaired.

THE GEEAT WESTERN BAILWAY CO. v. WILLIS. [18G5] 

(34 L. J. C. P. 195 ; 18 0. B. (N. S.) 748.) 

In an action against the railway company for not delivering 
within a reasonable time cattle which had been sent by their 
railway, the plaintiff gave evidence at the trial of a conversation 
which had taken place a week after the transaction between 
himself and the company's night inspector, who had charge of 
the night cattle trains at a station through which the trucks 
containing the plaintiff's cattle would pass, and in which conver- 
sation the night inspector, in reply to the plaintiff's question, 
" How is it you did not send my cattle on ? " had said that he 
had forgotten them. 

Held, on appeal, that such evidence was not admissible, 
as the " night inspector is not to be presumed to have been 
authorized by the company to make admissions on their 
behalf of things gone byP 



A Confession must be Free and Voluntary to be admissible. 

E, v. THOMPSON. [1893] 

(62 L. J. M. C. 93 ; (1893) 2 Q. B. 12 ; 5 E. 392 ; 69 L. T. 22 ; 
41 W. E, 525 ; 17 Cox, C. C. 641 ; 57 J. P. 312.) 

Upon a prosecution for embezzlement it was sought to prove 
a confession by the prisoner. Prior to the alleged confession 
the prosecutor had had an interview with the prisoner's brother 
and brother-in-law, and said, " It will be the right thing for 
Marcellus " (the prisoner) " to make a clean breast of it," but 
made no threat or promise to induce the prisoner to confess. 
The details of the interview were communicated to the prisoner. 



a-14 EVIDENCE. 

Held, by the Court for Crown Caws Reserved, that the 

confession was not free and voluntary, unci not admissible 
in evidence. 

A confession, in order to be admissible, must be free and 
voluntary, that is, it must not be extracted by ana sort of 
threats or violence, no)- obtained by any direct or implied 
promise however slight, nor by the exertion of any improper 
influence. 



An Entry made by a Deceased Person against Interest is 
admissible for all purposes. 

TAYLOR v. WITHAM. [1876] 
(45 L. J. Ch. 798 ; L. E. 3 Oh. 1). 605.) 

The question iu this action was whether a sum of 2,000/. 
advanced by William Taylor, who had since died, to "Witham 
was a loan or a gift iu the nature of a marriage portion. It 
was sought to put in evidence certain entries in the deceased's 
private cash-book which showed that payments had been made 
by way of interest and principal by Witham to Taylor. 

Held, by the Court of Appeal, that the evidence was 
admissible. 

There is an established rule in the Courts of this country 
that an entry against the interest of the man wJio makes it 
is receivable for all purposes. . . . Of course if you show 
aliunde that the man had a particular reason for making 
it, and that it was for his interest., you may destroy the 
value of the evidence altogether; but the question of admissi- 
bility is not a question of value. The entry may be utterly 
worthless whi n you get it in if you show any reason to 
believe that he had a motive for making it, and that though 
apparently against his interest, it really was for it. But 



HEARSAY EVIDENCE. 345 

that is a matter for subsequent consideration when you 
consider the value of the testimony. 

Note. — Higham v. Ridgway, 10 East, 109, is an oft-quoted 
instance of this rule. In that case the entry of a surgeon's 
attendance at a confinement, the fee for which was marked as 
•'paid," was held to be admissible as evidence of the date of birth 
of the infant. 



Parol Evidence may be given of the Contents of a Will or any lost 
Document. All Statements made by a Testator prior or 
subsequent to the execution of a Will are admissible as 
Evidence of its Contents. 

SUUDEN v. ST. LEONAEDS. [1876] 
(45 L. J. P. 49 ; L. E. 1 P. D. 154 ; 34 L. T. 372 ; 24 W. R. 800.) 

Lord St. Leonards, who was possessed of considerable real and 
personal estate, duly made and executed a holograph will, to 
which at different times he added eight codicils. The will and 
codicils were kept in a common box accessible to the inmates of 
the house. Upon the testator's death the will was missiug, and 
was never found. Thereupon a daughter of the testator wrote 
out the contents of the will from memory, there being no draft 
or copy of it. The daughter had lived with the testator all her 
life ; he had constantly consulted her about the will, and 
explained its provisions to her, and she had from time to time 
assisted him to make and alter it. It was admitted that there 
were some ulterior limitations of the real estate, and some small 
legacies which the daughter could not remember, but her 
veracity and honesty of purpose were not impugned by those 
who opposed probate. By the will the daughter took a con- 
siderable share in the testator's property, and particularly in the 
residuary personal estate. Her statement of the will was in 
some degree corroborated as to the realty by the codicils, and as 
to the personalty by other papers of the testator found in the 



346 EVIDENCE. 

box, and also by his verbal declarations made after the execu- 
tion of the will to his friends and relatives, but there was no 
direct corroboration of the residuary bequest to the daughter. 

Held, by the Court of Appeal, that being satisfied that 
there was sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of the 
testator's having destroyed the will u animo revocandi," 
and being also satisfied that the contents of the will were 
substantially as stated by the daughter, that probate of the 
will as written down by the daughter should be granted. 

That declarations made by the testator, whether before or 
after the execution of the ivill, were admissible as evidence 
of its contents. 



Hearsay Evidence is admissible of Reputation in Matters of 
Public Interest, but not of Individual Rights. 

R. v. BERGER. 

(63 L. J. Q. B. 529 ; (1894) 1 Q. B. 823 ; 10 E. 245; 70 L. T. 807 ; 
42 W. R. 541 ; 17 Cox, C. C. 761 ; 58 J. P. 416.) 

The defendant was indicted for obstructing a highway, 
namely, the Great North Road, in the parish of Finchley, in 
the county of Middlesex, by enclosing a strip of land previously 
unenclosed and lying between his own laud and the public 
footpath. The case was tried iu the Queen's Bench Division. 

In addition to other evidence given on behalf of the prosecu- 
tion, a map attached to an enclosure award made in 1814 was 
tendered and also an enlarged drawing of a part of the map. 

It was not disputed that the Great North Road was a high- 
way, and the map was not tendered in order to prove this, but 
for the purpose of showing the boundary of the highway at that 
time, and that the strip of land in dispute then formed part of it. 



HEARSAY EVIDENCE. 347 

The admission of the map in evidence was objected to on the 
part of the defendant, but the judge overruled the objection 
and admitted it. 

Held, by the Divisional Court, that the evidence had 
been tvrongly admitted, and directed a new trial. 

The map was made by one of the public, and therefore 
it could not have been excluded if it had been put in 
evidence upon the point as to tvhether the road teas a high- 
way, inasmuch as that is a matter of public interest. But 
that point was not in dispute, and the authorities referred to 
show that, although hearsay evidence is admissible as 
evidence of reputation in matters of public and general 
interest, it is not admissible as evidence of particular facts 
from which an inference may be drawn in respect of indi- 
vidual rights. If the contest had been whether the road 
was a public highway or not, the map would have been 
admissible as evidence of reputation to show that there was 
a public highway there, but it is not admissible to show the 
boundaries of the highway. 



In "Pedigree Cases" Evidence of the Conduct or a Statement of 
a Relative made ante litem motam are admissible. On this 
principle an entry in a Bible of the Birth of a Child is 
admissible. 

BERKELEY PEERAGE CASE. [1811] 

(4 Campbell, 401 ; 14 R, R. 782.) 

William Fitzharding Berkeley, the claimant, was born on 
the 26th December, 1786. He alleged that his father and 
mother were married in the parish of Berkeley on the 30th of 
March, 1785. They were likewise married in the parish of 



348 EVIDENCE. 

St. Mary, Lambeth, on the 10th of May, 1796, till which time 
Lady Berkeley did not appear as his lordship's wife ; nor was 
the claimant till some time after treated as their legitimate son. 
They had several children after the second marriage. The 
only question before the House of Lords respected the legiti- 
macy of the claimant ; and that depended entirely upon the 
reality of the first marriage alleged to have taken place between 
his parents. 

Thereupon the judges were summoned, and upon three 
questions submitted by the House of Lords for their considera- 
tion came to the conclusion that upon the trial of an ejectment 
respecting Black Acre between W. F. Berkeley and B., in which 
it was necessary for W. F. Berkeley to prove that he was the 
legitimate son of the Earl of Berkeley — 

(1) That W. F. Berkeley could not give in evidence a depo- 
sition made by the Earl of Berkeley in a cause in a Chancery 
action instituted by W. F. Berkeley against a third party in order 
to perpetuate testimony to the alleged fact, disputed by that third 
party, that he was the legitimate son of the Earl of Berkeley, in 
which case he claimed an estate in remainder in Whiteacre, 
which was also claimed in remainder by the third party. B., 
the defendaut in the ejectment, did not claim Black Acre under 
either W. F. Berkeley or the defendant to the Chancery suit. 

(2) That in a matter of pedigree W. F. Berkeley could give in 
evidence an entry in a Bible in which Bible the Earl of Berkeley 
had made an entry in his own handwriting that W. F. Berkeley 
was his eldest son born in lawful wedlock, by his wife, on the 
1 st day of May, 1778, and signed by the Earl of Berkeley himself. 

(3) That in a matter of pedigree such an entry may be given 
in evidence even though the Earl of Berkeley had declared that 
he had made the entry for the express purpose of establishing 
the legitimacy and the time of the birth of his eldest son, 
"W. F. Berkeley, in case the same should be called in question 
in anj r case or in any cause whatsoever by any persm after the 
death of him, the said Earl of Berkeley. 

The House of Lords, acting on the opinion of the judges, 



HEARSAY EVIDENCE. 349 

rejected the deposition of Lord Berkeley made in the Chancery 
action on the ground that, being a declaration made after a 
previous dispute, it was made post litem motam, and could not be 
received. 

As regards the entries in the Bible, the House of Lords 
agreed to the admissibility of such entries, whether made in a 
Bible or in any other book, for, iu the words of Eldon, L. C, 
" if the entry be the ordinary act of a man in the ordinary 
course of life, without interest or particular motive, this, as the 
spontaneous effusion of his own mind, may be looked at without 
suspicion and received without objection. Such is the contem- 
poraneous entry in a family Bible by a father of the birth of a 
child. But a doubt had been entertained upon this point, and 
it was fit that it should be solemnly decided. I agree to the 
admissibility of similar entries in other books. There is a great 
difference between the competency of evidence and the credit 
to which it is entitled." 

On the 28th June, 1811, the Committee of Privileges 
resolved, nemine dissentiente, that the claimant had not 
made good his claim to the Berkeley Peerage. 



A Declaration in a Pedigree Case may consist of a Statement of 
Family Reputation. 

DOE v. GEIFFIN. [1812] 
(15 East, 293; 13 E. B, 474.) 

In a trial for ejectment evidence was given by one of the 
family that, many years before, Thomas Griffin, a younger 
brother of the person last seised, had gone abroad, and that the 
repute of the family was that he had died there. The witness 
said she had never heard in the family of his having been 
married. 



350 EVIDENCE. 



field, this was primfi facie evidence that Thomas Griffin 
ivas dead without lawful issue, to entitle the next claimant 
by descent to recover in ejectment. 



Evidence given in a former Suit is admissible in a subsequent 
Action, provided the issue is the same and the parties in the 
subsequent Action are privies to the parties in the first 
Action. 

LLANOVEE v. HOMFEAY. [1881] 
(L. E. 19 Ch. D. 224 ; 30 W. E. 557.) 

In 1815 a bill was filed by four customary tenants of the 
Manor of Abercarne for and on behalf of themselves and all 
other the customary tenants against Benjamin Hall, the lord of 
the manor, claiming the right to work minerals on the land 
they held as tenants. In these proceedings certain witnesses 
were examined dc bene esse. No further steps were taken. In 
1871 a similar bill was filed by Messrs. Phillips on behalf of 
themselves and all the customary tenants against the heirs of 
Benjamin Hall. The plaintiffs in the second action did not 
derive title from any of the plaintiffs in the first action. 

It was sought to give in evidence the depositions taken in the 
first proceedings. 

Held, that this evidence was admissible in the present 
action. The previous suit was a suit by persons who were 
privies in estate with the present tenants ; they zvere not 
indeed owners of the same estate, but, as the suit was on 
behalf of all the tenants, it included the then owners of the 
estate, now belonging to the Messrs. Phillips^ and on the 
other side there was a lord of /he manor, who is now repre- 
sented by the present lord of the manor. Therefore it was 
a suit between persons privy in estate to the parties in the 



OPINIONS. 351 

present action. The issue in that suit zvas the same as that 
in the present action, and the evidence in one is, therefore, 
admissible in the other. Why should the evidence not be 
admissible ? The lord had an opportunity of cross-exam- 
ining, and the evidence answers every condition of admissi- 
bility, the last condition being that the witnesses must be 
dead or not producible, which, of course, is the case now 
with these old witnesses. 



OPINIONS. 



The Opinion of a Person is not as a rule admissible in Evidence. 
Expert Witnesses may give their Opinions in matters of 
Science or Art. 

FOLKE8 v. CHADD. [1782] 
(3 Douglas, 157.) 

This was an action of trespass for cutting a bank, where the 
question was whether the bank, which had been erected for the 
purpose of preventing the overflowing of the sea, had caused the 
choking up of a harbour. It was sought to give the opinions 
of scientific men as to the effect of such an embankment upon 
the harbour. This evidence was objected to on the ground that 
the verdict of the jury must be built entirely on facts and not 
on opinions. 

Held, per Mansfield, C. J., I In' widence was admissible 
as being evidence of a matter of science. The expert witness 
called understands the construction of harbours, the causes 
of their destruction, and how remedied. In matters of 
science no other tvitnesses can be called. An instance fre-

quently occurs in actions for unskilfully navigating ships, 
and when such questions come before me I always send for 
some of the brethren of the Trinity House. I cannot 
believe that where the question is whether a defect arises 
from a natural or an artificial cause, the opinions of men 
of science are not to be received. Handwriting is proved 
every day by opinion ; and for false evidence on such 
questions a man may be indicted for perjury. 



Evidence as to comparison of Handwriting is admissible if given 
by a Witness who from past experience is skilled in com- 
parison of Handwriting. He need not have gained his skill 
professionally. 

R. v. SILYERLOCK. [1894] 

(63 L. J. M. C. 233 ; (1894) 2 Q. B. 766 ; 10 R. 431 ; 72 L. T. 298 ; 

43 W. R. 14; 18 Cox, C. 0. 104; 58 J. R. 788.) 

In the course of the trial it was proposed to prove a certain 
draft advertisement and certain letters alleged to be in the prisoner's 
handwriting by comparison of the handwriting in such docu- 
ments with that of admitted handwriting of the prisoner ; and 
the solicitor for the prosecution was called as an expert for this 
purpose. 

Counsel for the prisoner objected that the solicitor was not an 
expert. The objection was overruled and the evidence admitted. 

Held, by the Court for Crown Cases Reserved, per Lord 
Russell, C. J. : — 

" This is an illustration of evidence as to opinion, and it 
is quite clear thai the tvitness must be skilled (peritus). But 
I cannot assent to the proposition that he must be skilled in 
the ivay of his business. The question is, Is he peritus ? 
/ know of no case ivhich requires /hat a man who is skilled

in comparison of handwriting, who, from past experience, is 
able to give an opinion upon a question of handwriting, is to 
he excluded because he has not gained that skill in the ivay 
of his profession. But in tJtis particular case it is un- 
necessary to consider this point, for the man ivas peritus, 
and peritus in the wag of his business. The case states 
that l he had, quite apart from his professional tvork, for 
some gears — that is, since 1884 — given considerable atten- 
tion and study to handwriting, and especially to old 
parish registers and wills.' He said he had on several 
occasions professionallg compared evidence in handivriting, 
but said he had never before given evidence as to hand- 
writing. He stated that he had formed an opinion that the 
prisoner was guilty before he began to compare the hand- 
writing. 

11 When it is determined that evidence is admissible, the 
rest is a (question of what vjeight is to be given to UP 



CHARACTER. 



If a Prisoner on his Trial gives evidence that his Character is 
good, it is open for the Prosecution, by way of reply, to 
prove that the prisoner's Character is bad. Evidence of 
Character must not be evidence of Particular Facts but 
of General Reputation only having reference to the nature 
of the charge. 

E. v. EOWTON. [1865J 

(34 L. J.M.C.57; 11L.T.745; 13W.E. L3G; 11 Jur. (N. S.) 325 ; 

10 Cox, 0. C. 25; L. &amp; C. 520.) 

On a trial for an indecent assault where the defendant had 
given evidence of his good character, a witness called by the 
J. a a

prosecution to rebut such evidence was asked : " What is the 
defendant's general character for decency and morality of con- 
duct ? " The witness said : " I know nothing of the neigh- 
bourhood's opinion, because I was only a boy at school when I 
knew him ; but my own opinion, and the opinion of my 
brothers, who were also pupils of his, is that his character is 
that of a man capable of the grossest indecency and the most 
flagrant immorality." 

Held, by the Court for Crotvn Cases Reserved, that this 
answer was not admissible in evidence. 

If a prisoner on his trial gives evidence that his character 
is good, it is open for the prosecution, by way of reply, to 
prove that the prisoner's character is bad. Evidence of 
character must not be evidence of particular facts, but 
must be evidence of general reputation only having reference 
to the nature of the charge. 



JUDICIAL NOTICE. 



General Customs are judicially noticed. 

BRANDAO v. BARNETT. [1846] 
(3 C. B. 519 ; 12 C. &amp; F. 787 ; 69 E. R. 204.) 

One Edward Burn bought on behalf of the plaintiff, and 
with the plaintiff's money, certain exchequer bills, which Burn 
deposited in a box that he kept at his bankers, and himself 
retained the key. Whenever it became necessary to receive 
interest on the exchequer bills, and to exchange them for new 
ones, Burn used to take them out of the box and, in the usual 
course of business, hand them to the bank. As soon as the 
bank obtained the new bills they would credit Burn's account 



JUDICIAL NOTICE. 355 

with the interest, give the bills over to Burn, who replaced them 
in the box, which he handed back to the bank. The exchequer 
bills were never entered to Burn's account, nor had the bankers 
any notice or knowledge that they were not the property of 
Burn. 

On the last occasion the bills were handed over to the bank 
by Burn in the usual way, and on account of his illness the 
new bills remained in their hands for nearly two months right 
up to the time of Burn's failure. Burn's account being con- 
siderably overdrawn the bank, on his failure, claimed a lien on 
the bills. 

Held, in an action by the plaintiff, that the general lien 
of bankers is part of the laiv merchant, and is to be 
judicially noticed, for when a general usage has been 
ascertained and established it becomes part of the law mer- 
chant which courts of justice are bound to know and 
recognise, and, therefore, bankers most undoubtedly have a 
general lien on all securities deposited with them as bankers 
by a customer, unless there be an express contract or cir- 
cumstances that show an implied contract inconsistent with 
lien. 

In this case the exchequer bills were not deposited with 
the defendants as bankers, and there was an implied agree- 
ment on the part of the defendants inconsistent with the 
right of lien, which the defendants claimed. The plaintiff 
was therefore entitled to judgment for the return of the 
bills. 

Note. — Particular customs must be proved.

DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE. 



In order to prove a Document which has been attested the 
Attesting Witness must be called if his attsndance can be 
procured. Proof of Acknowledgment of Obligor does not do 
away with the Obligation. 

ABBOT v. PLUMBE. [1779] 
(1 Douglas, 216.) 

In this action, to prove the petitioning creditor's debt which 
arose by bond, a witness was called, who swore that the bankrupt 
had acknowledged to him that he owed the debt. The sub- 
scribing witness was an attorney who lived in Somerset. He 
was not called, nor was there any proof that he had been 
required to attend or that he could not have been procured. 

Held, that it was necessary, in order to recover on a 
bond, to call the subscribing witness. His attendance 
cannot be dispensed with, unless it appears that his attend- 
ance could not be procured. It was formerly dot/bird 
whether, if the subscribing witness denies the deed, you can 
call other witnesses to prove it. But it has now been deter- 
mined that in such a case other witnesses mag be examined. 



Secondary Evidence of the Contents of a Document of which no 
Notice to produce has been given is inadmissible. 

E. v. ELWOETHY. [1867] 

(37 L. J. M. C. 3 ; L. E. 1 C. C. E. 103 ; 17 L. T. 293 ; 

16 W. E. 207 ; 10 Cox, C. C. 579.) 

Kl worthy Avas tried for perjury by Willes, J., and a jury at 
the Old Bailey. It was alleged by the prosecution that a state- 



DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE. 357 

ment Elworthy had made at the trial of one Cannon that there 
was not a draft of a certain statutory declaration was false, and 
that in making such a statement he had committed perjury. 
No notice to produce had been given, nor was there any subpoena 
duces tecum to the prisoner's partner to produce the alleged 
draft, and the prisoner's counsel objected that secondary 
evidence could not be given thereof. Secondary evidence of 
the document was admitted subject to the opinion of the Court 
for Crown Cases Reserved as to the propriety of that course, and 
the prisoner was convicted. 

Held, by the Court for Crown Cases Reserved, the prose- 
cutor might have contented himself with giving evidence of 
the existence of the document, but he chose to go farther 
and give evidence of its contents. No notice to produce 
having been served upon the prisoner, and there being nothing 
on the indictment to give notice to the prisoner that he tvould 
be required to produce the original draft, secondary evidence 
of its contents tvas not admissible, and the conviction must, 
therefore, be quashed. 



Secondary Evidence of the Contents of a Document may be given 
where a Document has been lost or destroyed and a proper 
Search has been made for it. The amount of Search neces- 
sary depends on Value of Document. 

BREWSTER v. SEWELL. [1820] 

(3 B. &amp; Aid. 296; 22 B. R. 395.) 

This was an action brought by the plaintiff to recover damages 
for libel by the defendant. Some six years before the action 
the plaintiff, under a fire policy, had recovered for the loss he 
had sustained by a fire. The libel alleged that he had made a 
fraudulent claim with regard to this fire. The policy had 
been returned to the insurance company after the fire, and 



358 EVIDENCE. 

when paid had become useless paper, which the agent of the 
company believed he had returned to the plaintiff. The clerk 
to the plaintiffs solicitor proved that he went to the plaintiff's 
house to search for the policy, when the plaintiff showed him 
every drawer where he usually kept his papers ; that he examined 
such drawers, and every other place where he thought it likely 
to find such a paper, without finding it. 

Held, that this was sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to 
give secondary evidence of the contents of the policy. 

In a case of this kind, where the document in question is 
practically ivaste paper, very slight evidence of its destruction 
is necessary ; but where the document is an important one, 
or if there be reason to suspect that the party not producing 
it has a strong interest which would induce him to withhold 
it, a very strict examination would be required. 



There are no Degrees of Secondary Evidence ; consequently Parol 
Evidence of the contents of a Deed may be given although 
an attested copy appears to be in existence. 

DOE v. EOSS. [1840] 

(10 L. J. Ex. 201 ; 4 Jur. 321 ; 7 M. &amp; W. 102 ; 8 D. P. C. 389.) 

An attorney having been subpoenaed to produce a deed in his 
possession which he had received from Mr. Weetman, a client, 
declined to do so on the ground that he had a lien upon it for 
professional business done for Mr. Weetman. A copy of the 
deed was then offered in evidence by the plaintiff, but as it 
appeared to have been made an attested copy and not to have 
been stamped, it was rejected. The plaintiff then proposed to 
read, as secondary evidence of the contents of the deed, the 
notes taken by a shorthand writer of a former trial, in an action 
brought by the present lessors of the plaintiff against Mr. 



DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE. 359 

Weetman, who had then produced the original deed as part of 
his case. It appeared from the shorthand notes that the deed 
had not been read by the officer of the Court but that its 
contents had been stated by the junior counsel for the defendant 
and had been taken down by the shorthand writer. This 
evidence was admitted although objected to by the counsel for 
the defendant. 

Held, by the Court of Exchequer, that secondary evidence 
of the deed was admissible, and that the evidence had been 
properly admitted. 

There are no degrees of secondary evidence. If a party 
has a copy of a deed in his possession, and, instead of pro- 
ducing it, thinks fit to offer parol evidence of its contents, 
that woidd be an argument to the jury that the copy if pro- 
duced would be adverse to his case. But there is no special 
ground for holding that parol evidence in such a case may 
not be adduced. 



Where a Contract is required to be in writing by the Statute of 
Frauds all its terms must appear, and no Evidence may be 
given of a precedent variation thereof ; but Evidence may 
be given of a subsequent variation in writing or of a Waiver 
or Abandonment of the written Contract whether by writing 
or parol. Where a Contract not required to be in writing is 
reduced into writing, generally Evidence of a precedent or 
collateral variation thereof is inadmissible ; but Evidence 
may be given of a subsequent Variation or Waiver if made 
before Breach of the Contract. 

GOSS v. NUGENT. [1833] 

(2 L. J. K. B. 127 ; 5 B. &amp; Ad. 58 ; 2 N. &amp; M. 28.) 

By agreement in writing the plaintiff contracted to sell the 

defendant several lots of land and to make a good title to 

them, and a deposit was paid. It was afterwards discovered 

that a good title could not be made to one of the lots, and it 



360 EVIDENCE. 

was then verbally agreed between the parties that the vendee 
should waive the title as to that lot. The vendor delivered 
possession of the whole of the lots to the vendee, which he 
accepted. 

In an action brought by the vendor to recover the remainder 
of the purchase-nioney, the declaration stated that the vendor 
agreed to deduce a good title to all the lots except one, and that 
the vendee discharged and exonerated him from making out a 
good title to that lot and waived his right to require same. 

Held, by the general rules of the common law, if there be 
a contract which has been reduced into tori ting, verbal 
evidence is not alloivcd to be given of what passed between 
the parties, either before the written instrument ivas made 
or during the time that it ivas in a state of preparation, so 
as to add to or subtract from, or in any manner to vary or 
qualify the toritten contract ; but after the agreement has 
been reduced into writing, it is competent to the parties, at 
any time before breach of it, by a new contract, not in 
/^riling, either altogether to waive, dissolve, or annul the 
former agreement, or in any manner to add to or subtract 
from, or vary or qualify the terms of it, and thus to make 
a new contract ; which is to be proved partly by the written 
agreement and partly by the subsequent verbal terms 
engrafted upon what will be thus left of the written agree- 
ment. 

If the present contract did not come under the Statute of 
Frauds it would hare hem competent to the parties to it to 
dispense with requiring a good title to be made to the lot in 
question, and the action might have been maintained, but as 
it came within the Statute of Frauds, 29 Car. 2, c. 3, 
6'. 4, oral testimony was not admissible to show the waiver 
of the vendee's right to a good title as to that lot, inasmuch 



DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE. 361 

as the effect of that waiver was to substitute a different 
contract for the one in ivriting, and by this statute in every 
action brought to charge a person on a contract for the sale 
of lands, the whole agreement must be in writing. 

Our opinion is not formed upon the stipulation about the 
title being an essential part of the agreement, but upon the 
general effect and meaning of the Statute of Frauds, that 
the contract now being brought forward bg the plaintiff is 
not ivholly a contract in writing. We do not sag that 
verbal evidence may not be given of customs and usages 
applicable to the subject-matter of the written contract 
where the contract is silent ; that has been done in a great 
variety of instances. 

It is to be observed that the statute docs not say in dis- 
tinct terms that all contracts of agreements concerning the 
sale of lands shall be in writing. All that it enacts is that 
no action shall be brought unless they are in writing, and as 
there is no clause in the Act which requires the dissolution 
of such contracts to be in writing, it should rather seem that 
a written contract concerning the sale of lands may still be 
waived and abandoned by a new agreement not in ivriting, 
so as to prevent either party from recovering on the contract 
ivhich vjas in writing. 

Note. — To the general rule contained in the head-note there are 
several exceptions, for parol evidence may be given to prove fraud, 
duress, illegality, want or failure of consideration, mistake of fact, 
or that the bargain was harsh and unconscionable under the 
Moneylenders Act, l l J00 (63 &amp; 64 Vict. c. 51). Parol evidence is 
also admissible in the four cases which follow. 



362 EVIDENCE. 

Parol Evidence may be given to incorporate into a Contract a 
Custom which is not inconsistent with the Terms of the 
Written Agreement. 

SMITH v. WILSON. [1832] 
(1 L. J. K. B. 194 ; 3 B. &amp; Ad. 728 ; 37 R. E. 536.) 
In a lease it was provided that at the end of the term the tenant 
should have not less than 10,000 rabbits on the premises, to be 
taken and paid for by the landlord, the defendant, at the rate of 
60/. " per thousand." Evidence was offered on behalf of the 
defendant to show that the term " thousand," when applied to 
rabbits, in that part of the country meant 100 dozen. The 
admissibility of the evidence was objected to on the ground that 
the term had a legal fixed acceptation known to the law. The 
evidence was, however, admitted, and its effect in the result 
was that the defendant obtained a verdict. 

A rule having been obtained for setting aside the verdict and 
for a new trial on the ground that this evidence was improperly 
admitted — 

Held, that the evidence was 'properly admitted and the 
rule must be discharged. 

It must be supposed that the parties to the deed used the 
word " thousand" tvith reference to the subject-matter accord- 
ing to the meaning which it received in that part of the 
country. 

Parol Evidence may be given to explain a Latent but not a 
Patent Ambiguity in a Document. 

DOE v. NEEDS. [1836] 
(6 L. J. Ex. 59 ; 2 M. &amp; W. 129 ; 46 E. E. 52.) 

The testator devised a house to George Gord, the son of John 
Gord ; another to George Gord, the son of George Gord ; and a 
third to George Gord, the x&lt;&gt;» of Gord. The question arose as to 
which of the two George Gords was intended to have the third 
house. 



DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE. 363 

Held, that evidence of the testators declarations was 
admissible to show that he intended the house devised to 
11 George the son of Gord^ should go to George, the son of 
George Gord. 

If upon the face of the devise it had been uncertain 
whether the devisor had selected a particular object of his 
bounty, no evidence would have been admissible to prove that 
he intended a gift to a certain individual, for that woidd 
be a case of patent ambiguity. But here, on the face of the 
devise, no such doubt arises, for the devisor has clearly 
selected a particular individual as the devisee. As the will 
does describe the object intended, the evidence of the declara- 
tion of the testator has not the effect of varying the 
instrument in any way whatever ; it only enables the Court 
to reject one of the objects to which the description applies, 
and to determine which of the two the devisor understood to 
be signified by the description which he used in the will. 



Evidence may be given of a collateral Parol Agreement which is 
not inconsistent with the Written Agreement. 

DE LASSALLE v. GUILDFORD. [1901] 
(70 L. J. K. B. 533 ; (1901) 2 K. B. 215 ; 84 L. T. 549 ; 

49 W. R. 467— C. A.) 

Upon the execution of a lease of a dwelling-house, the land- 
lord verbally warranted that the drains were in good condition. 
The lease contained covenants by the lessee to do the inside, 
and by the lessor to do the outside repairs, but was silent as to 
the then condition of the drains. 

Held, that the lease did not contain the tvhole of the con- 
tract between the parties, as it was entirely silent about the 
drains. The warranty as to the drains was what induced 



364 EVIDENCE. 

the tenancy^ and it in no way affected the terms of the 
tenancy during the three //curs, which was all the lease dealt 
with. The 'warranty in no way contradicted the lease, and 
without it the lease tvoidd never have been executed. 

The parol warranty being collateral to the lease and not 
contradicting the lease was admissible in evidence, and the 
tenant ivas entitled to main/ ''tin an action for the breach 
of it. 

Note. — III Greswolde- Williams v. Barneby, 83 L. T. 708, the 
plaintiff sued for breach of warranty contained in an agreement 
for a lease which was not incorporated in the conveyance. It was 
held that no action la}' on the warranty, on the ground that where 
a preliminary contract is superseded by one of a superior character 
then the superior contract prevails. It is submitted that this 
decision, being in conflict with the Court of Appeal decision in 
De Lassulle v. Guildford, is not good law. 



Evidence is admissible to show that a Document which on the face 
of it appears to be a Written Agreement was subject to a 
condition which was not fulfilled and that no Agreement was 
really come to. 

PYM v. CAMPBELL AND OTHEES. [1856 J 

(25 L. J. Q. B. 277 ; 27 L. T. 122 ; 4 W. E. 528 ; 20 Jur. (N. S.) 641 ; 

6 E. &amp; B. 370.) 

The plaintiff brought this action for breach by the defendants 
of an agreement in writing to purchase from him three eighth 
shares of a certain invention for grinding ores and separating 
the metal therefrom. The agreement in qiiestion had been duly 
signed by the plaintiff and the defendants. 

For the defendants, evidence was given that the defendants 
at the time of the negotiation declined to purchase the shares 
in the invention unless one Abernethy, an engineer, approved 



PRESUMPTIONS AS TO DOCUMENTS. 365 

of the machine, and that, as Abernethy was absent and one of 
the defendants could not conveniently return to sign the docu- 
ment, it was agreed between the parties that the defendants 
should sign the memorandum conditionally upon Abernethy's 
approval being obtained ; and that Abernethy had disapproved 
of the machine. 

Believing this evidence, the jury gave a verdict for the 
defendants, for whom judgment was entered. 

Held, by the Exchequer Chamber, on appeal, that the 
judgment must be upheld. 

That the evidence tvhich had been given as to why the 
agreement ivas signed was admissible, as it was not evidence 
to vary or alter an actual written agreement but to shoiv 
that the paper tvas not an agreement. The parties never 
had an agreeing mind, but signed the paper for convenience, 
leaving it to take effect or not, according as Abernethy did 
or did not approve ; and there tvas nothing to prevent their 
doing so. 



PRESUMPTIONS AS TO DOCUMENTS. 



Documents thirty years old coming from proper Custody prove 

themselves. 

DOE v. PHILLIPS. [1845] 
(15 L J. Q. B. 47 ; 8 Q. B. 158 ; 10 Jur. 34.) 

A deed more than thirty years old was produced from the 
custody of the plaintiff's attorne}^. There was evidence that 
the attorney had acted for the family of the defendant, who 
were beneficially interested in the premises to which the deed 



366 EVIDENCE. 

related, and it was not shown for whom the attorney held the 
deed. 

Held, it certainly is not necessary to show that such a 
document as this comes from what, in strictness, would be 
its legal custody. It is sufficient if its actual custody be 
reasonable and natural. 

In this case there ivas sufficient prima facie evidence of 
the deed coming from the proper custody, and it was, there- 
fore, properly admissible without proof of execution. 



It is a Presumption of Law that Alterations in a Deed were made 
before Execution. There is no such presumption in the case 
of a Will. 

DOE v. CATOMOEE. [1851] 

(16 Q. B. 745 ; 20 L. J. Q. B. 364 ; 83 E. E. 714.) 

On the trial, before Parke, B., in a lease and assignment, 
when produced in evidence, there appeared certain erasures and 
interlineations in parts of the deeds which were not material ; not 
being either in the covenant to insure or in the proviso for 
re-entry. It was objected that the deeds were void, unless 
evidence were given to explain when and by whom the erasures 
and interlineations had been made. The learned judge left it 
to the jury to say upon the deeds themselves whether such 
erasures and interlineations had been made before or after the 
execution of the deeds. The jury found that they had been 
made before, and returned their verdict in favour of the 
plaintiff. 

Held, In) the Exchequer Chamber, that the defendant had 
no rigid to complain of the course pursued by the learned 
judge at the trial. The doctrine laid down in a note 
(1) [136J in Hargrave and Butler's edition of Coke upon 



PRESUMPTIONS. 367 

Littleton that " y Tis to be presumed that an interlining, if 
the contrary is not proved, was made at the time of making 
the deed" seems to rest upon principle. A deed cannot be 
altered, after it is executed, without fraud or wrong ; and 
the presumption is against fraud or wrong. A testator 
may alter his will without fraud or wrong after it has been 
executed, and there is no ground for any presumption that 
the alteration was made bejore the will was executed. 



PRESUMPTIONS. 



Seven Years' Absence without good cause creates presumption 
of Death sometime during that time. 

NEPEAN v. DOE. [1837] 
(2 M. &amp; W. 894 ; 46 B. E. 789.) 

In this action it was very material to ascertain the exact date 
of the death of Matthew Knight, who went to America at the 
end of 1807, and of whom, with the exception of one letter 
announcing his arrival, nothing had been heard for twenty years. 

Held, where a person goes abroad and is not heard of 
for seven years the laiv presumes the fact that such person 
is dead, but not that he died at the beginning or the end of 
any particular period during those seven years ; that if it 
is important to anyone to establish the precise time of such 
persons death, he must do so by evidence of some sort, to be 
In id before the jury for that purpose, beyond the mere lapse 
of seven years since such person was last heard of 

Note. — The presumption is now created by absence for seven 
years without proof that the person went abroad. 

Note also that the presumption of death is negatived where the 
person who is not beard of for seven years has reason to conceal 
bis whereabouts. 



368 EVIDENCE. 

There is no presumption from Age or Sex, &amp;c., as to which of two 
persons destroyed by the same calamity died first. 

WING v. ANGRAVK [1860] 

(30 L. J. Ch. 65; 8 H. L. 183.) 

John Underwood, his wife and two children were swept off 
the deck of a vessel by one wave, and there was no distinct 
evidence that any one was seen later than another, although 
evidence was given that the husband was a strong man and a 
good swimmer, and the wife was a weak and delicate woman 
and could not swim at all. 

The wife made a will by which, under a power of appointment 
reserved to her in her father's will, she bequeathed her property 
to her husband, " and in case my said husband shall die in my 
lifetime," to William Wing. The husband made a will in the 
same terms. No evidence was given to prove that one survived 
the other. 

Held, by the House of Lords, that they would not assume 
that one survived the other. That William Wing could not 
claim under cither will, and that the property ivent over to 
those who by the father's will tvere to take in default of 
appointment by Mrs. Underwood. 

The union of the two titles in William Wing did not affect 
the case, for he could not succeed in one because lie did not 
succeed under the other, but was bound to establish his 
claim clearly under one or the other. 

There is not in the English law {unlike the Code 
Napoleon, which had been relied on) any presumption from 
age, sex, or other circumstance as to the survivorship of 
one out of several persons who arc destroyed by (he same 
calamity. 



ESTOPPEL. 369 



ESTOPPEL. 



A Person is estopped from denying the Truth of Recitals or 
Contents of a Deed he has made. 

BOWMAN v. TAYLOE. [1834] 
(4 L. J. K. B. 58 ; 2 Ad. &amp; E. 278 ; 4 N. &amp; M. 264 ; 41 E. E. 437.) 

The declaration in covenant alleged a deed by which the 
plaintiff granted to the defendant a licence to use certain looms, 
by which deed it was recited that the plaintiff had invented 
certain improvements, &amp;c. in power-looms, and had obtained 
letters patent and caused a specification to be enrolled. 

Held, that the defendant was estopped from pleading that 
the plaintiff iv as not the inventor, that it was not a new 
invention, and that no specification had been enrolled. 

An estoppel operates because it concludeth a man to allege 
the truth by reason of the assertion of the party that the 
fact is true. If a party has by his deed directly asserted 
a specific fact, it is impossible to say that he shall not be 
precluded from disputing that fact thus solemnly admitted 
by him on the face of his deed. 



A Tenant is estopped from denying his Landlord's Title. 

COOKE v. LOXLEY. [1792] 
(5 T. E. 4; 2 E. E, 521.) 

In an action for use and occupation by an incumbent against 
a tenant of the glebe lands who had paid him rent, the defendant 

J. B B 



370 EVIDENCE. 

sought to give evidence of a simoniacal presentation by the 
plaintiff in order to avoid his title. 

Held, the general rule was that in such an action as this 
the tenant could not dispute the landlord's title, for it ought 
not to be permitted to a tenant who occupies land by the 
licence of another to call upon that other to show the title 
under which he let the land. 



A Judgment in an Action operates as an Estoppel. 

EX PARTE BANK OF ENGLAND, IN RE SOUTH 
AMERICAN AND MEXICAN COMPANY. [1895] 

(1 Ch. 37 ; 12 R. 1 ; 71 L. T. 594 ; 43 W. R. 131.) 

In an action brought by the Bank of England against the 
American and Mexican Company, judgment was given for the 
Bank of England by consent of the parties for 100,000/. and 
costs after the case had been partly tried. The company was 
subsequently ordered to be wound up, and the bank claimed to 
prove for the amount still unpaid on the judgment. The 
official receiver and liquidator rejected the proof on practically 
the grounds set out by the company in their defence to the 
action 

Held, that a judgment by consent is intended to put a 
stop to litigation between the parties just as much as a 
judgment which results from the decision of the Court after 
the mutter has been fought out to the end, and that in either 
case the judgment acts as an estoppel. 



COMPETENCY OF WITNESSES. 371 



COMPETENCY OF WITNESSES. 



A Lunatic may give Evidence where he is of competent under- 
standing to give rational Evidence and is aware of the 
Nature and Obligation of the Oath. 

E. v. HILL. [1851] 
(20 L. J. M. C. 222 ; 2 Den. C. C. 254.) 

Hill was charged with the offence of manslaughter. The 
deceased and Donelly were both lunatic patients at an asylum 
at the time of the supposed injury to the deceased. Donelly 
suffered from the delusion that he was constantly surrounded by 
spirits who continually talked to him. But for this delusion he 
was perfectly rational. In spite of his evidence being objected 
to he was called, and the prisoner convicted. 

Held , by the Court for Crown Cases Reserved, his 
evidence was admissible. 

If a lunatic be tendered as a witness, it is for the judge 
to examine whether the lunatic be of competent understand- 
ing to give rational evidence, and is aware of the nature and 
obligation of an oath. If the judge is satisfied on these 
points he should admit the lunatic as a witness. 

Before being sworn, the lunatic mag be examined and 
witnesses mag be called as to his competency . 

If he be admitted, it is for the jury to judge whether his 
evidence be tainted by his insanity, and to decide upon the 
degree of credit to be attached to it.

372 EVIDENCE. 

The Privilege attaching to Communications made by a person to 
his Solicitor in his professional capacity does not extend to 
Communications made in furtherance of any Criminal or 
Fraudulent Purpose. 

E, v. COX AND EAILTON. [1884] 

(54 L. J. M. C. 41 ; L. E. 14 Q. B. D. 153 ; 52 L. T. 25 ; 
33 W. E. 396 ; 49 J. P. 314 ; 15 Cox, 611.) 

The two prisoners were indicted for a conspiracy with intent 
to defraud Henry Munster. Railton had been the defendant 
in a libel action brought against him by Munster, in which the 
latter obtained 40s. damages and costs. Execution being levied 
to obtain these costs, the sheriff was met by a bill of sale from 
Eailton to Cox. Railton and Cox had been previously partners, 
but a deed was produced by Railton to show that the dissolution 
had taken place before the judgment, whereas as a matter of 
fact it had taken place after. 

Railton and Cox had consulted their solicitor as to the 
possibility of defeating the execution by a bill of sale. At the 
trial the solicitor was called to give evidence of what had taken 
place at the consultation. In spite of an objection to this 
evidence it was admitted and the prisoners convicted. 

Held, by the Court for Grown Cases Reserved, that the 
evidence was properly ((dm it ted. 

The privilege attaching to communications made by a 
person to a solicitor in his professional capacity does not 
extend to communications made in furtherance of any crimi- 
nal or fraudulent purpose. 

When upon the trial of such person the solicitor is called 
upon to disclose what passed betiveen him and the accused 
at the professional consultation, the Court must, upon the 
special facts of each particular case, judge of the admissi- 
bility of the proposed evidence. Although the consultation 
being held before or after the commission of the offence is 



COMPETENCY OP WITNESSES. 873 

not decisive, the Court must in each case determine, upon 
the facts given in evidence, whether it seems probable that 
the accused consulted the solicitor not after the commission 
of the crime for the legitimate purpose of being defended, 
but before the commission of the crime for the purpose of 
being guided and helped in committing it. 



A Witness is not bound to incriminate himself. The Court must 
judge whether there is any reasonable ground to apprehend 
danger to the Witness from his being compelled to answer. 

R. v. BOYES. [1861] 
(30 L. J. Q. B. 301 ; 5 L. T. 147; 7 Jur. 1158; 1 B. &amp; S. 311.) 

On the trial of an information laid by the Attorney- General 
by order of the House of Commons against the defendant for 
bribery at a parliamentary election, a person to whom it was 
charged that the defendant had given a bribe was called as a 
witness and refused to answer any question connected with the 
defendant, on the ground that the answer would tend to 
criminate him ; a pardon under the Great Seal was then handed 
to the witness, but he still refused to answer, on which the 
presiding judge compelled him to answer, and on his evidence 
the defendant was convicted. 

Held, that the pardon took away the privilege of the 
witness so far as any risk of prosecution at the suit of the 
Crown was concerned ; and that though the witness might 
still be liable to an impeachment by the House of Commons 
notwithstanding the pardon, by reason of the 12 6r 13 
Will. 3, c. 2, an impeachment tvas so unlikely that the 
witness could not be said to be in any real danger, and he 
was rightly compelled to answer. 

In order to entitle a witness to the privilege of not 
answering a Question as tending to criminate him, the Court 



374 EVIDENCE. 

must see from the circumstances of the case and the nature 
of the evidence which the witness is called to give that there 
is reasonable ground to apprehend danger to the witness from 
his being compelled to amiver. But if the fact of the 
ivitness being in danger be once made to appear, great lati- 
tude should be alloived to him in judging of the effect of any 
particular question. The danger to be apprehended must be 
real and appreciable with reference to the ordinary operation 
of law in the ordinary course of things, and not a danger of 
an imaginary character, having reference to some barely 
possible contingency. 



The uncorroborated Evidence of an Accomplice implicating 
another Prisoner is not admissible against him. 

EEX v. DIBBLE, ALIAS CORCOEAN. [1908] 
(72 J. E. 498.) 

Dibble and White were indicted for burglary, which it was 
alleged by the prosecution they had committed in the company 
of Williams. Williams and White both made confessions, and 
in a written statement implicated Dibble. There was no other 
evidence against Dibble except the circumstance that Dibble, 
although he at first denied knowing Williams and White, sub- 
sequently admitted he knew them. At the trial Dibble and 
White pleaded not guilty. White went into the witness box 
and was cross-examined about his confession which he now said 
was false. Williams, who admitted that he was guilty, swore 
that neither Dibble nor White were guilty, thereupon his con- 
fession was put to him in cross-examination. 

The two confessions implicating Dibble thus came to the 
notice of the jury, and although the judge in summing up told 
the jury to disregard these confessions, and advised tliem to 



EXAMINATION OF WITNESSES. 375 

acquit Dibble, they nevertheless found him guilty. Dibble 
appealed. 

Held, by the Court of Criminal Appeal, the appeal must 
be allowed and the conviction quashed. 

u The difficulty arises in part from the fact that White 
and the appellant were tried together, and evidence against 
White was heard by the Jury which, though it concerned the 

appellant, ivas not admissible in evidence against him 

The learned Recorder cautioned the jury, and did his best 
to prevent them acting on those statements to the prejudice 
of the appellant. But the fact remains, these statements 
did come to the minds of the jury. We cannot help feeling 
that the jury may have thought that Williams and White 
told the truth about the appellant in their written statements. 
All this is beside the point if there was substantial evidence 
apart from those statements. . . . But we do not think that 
this evidence, apart Jrom the written statements, is such that 
a jury could convict upon it." 



EXAMINATION OF WITNESSES. 



Any question may be put to a Witness in cross-examination as to 
Credit, but where the question is collateral to the matter in 
issue the answer must be taken as conclusive, and other 
Witnesses cannot be called to contradict him. 

HAEEIS v. TIPPETT. [1811] 
(2 Campbell, 637; 1 1 P. E. 767.) 

A witness for the defendant was asked in cross-examination 
whether he had not attempted to dissuade a witness examined 



376 EVIDENCE. 

for the plaintiff from attending the trial. He swore positively 
that he had not. 

The counsel for the plaintiff then proposed to call back the 
other to contradict him. 

Held, by Lawrence, J. : " That cannot be done. You must 
hike his answer. Had this been a matter in issue, I would 
have alloived you to call witnesses to contradict what the 
last witness has sworn ; but it is entirely collateral, and 
you must take his answer. 1 will permit questions to be 
put to a witness as to any improper conduct of which he 
may have been guilty for the purpose of trying his credit ; 
hut when these questions are irrelevant to the issue on the 
record, you cannot call other witnesses to contradict the 
answers he gives. JS T o witness can be prepared to support 
his character as to particular facts, and such collateral 
inquiries tvould lead to endless confusion." 



Where a Witness is asked if he has made a certain statement 
which is material to the issue and at variance with other 
parts of his Evidence, and he denies that he has made such 
statement, Evidence may be given to show that he did in fact 
make the statement. Where a witness is examined as to a 
fact with a view to show that he is biassed and he denies the 
fact, Evidence may be offered in contradiction to prove the 
fact. 

ATTOENEY-GENEEAL v. HITCHCOCK. [1847] 
(16 L. J. Ex. 259; 11 Jur. 478; 1 Ex. 91 ; 74 E. E. 592.) 

In an information against the defendant for using a cistern 
in the making of malt, without making an entry thereof, as 
required by the Act of Parliament, a witness was asked by the 
defendant's counsel if he had not stated to one Cook that the 



EXAMINATION OF WITNESSES. 377 

Excise officers had offered him 20/. to say the cistern had heen 
used. The witness having denied the alleged statement — 

Held, that evidence could not be given to shoiv that he 
had, in fact, made the statement. 

When the answer given is not material to the issue, public 
convenience requires that it be taken as decisive, and that 
no contradiction be alloived. In the present case the witness 
was asked whether he had been offered a bribe to say the 
cistern had been used. This was not material, nor did it 
qualify what had gone be/ore, for his being offered a bribe 
did not show that he was not a fair and credible witness. 

Where, however, a witness is asked if he has made a 
certain statement which is material to the issue and at 
variance with other parts of his evidence, and he denies that 
he has made such statement, evidence mag be given to shoiv 
that he did, in fact, make the statement. 

Where a witness is examined as to a fact with a 
view to show that he is biassed as to the cause, and he 
denies the fact, evidence mag be offered in contradiction to 
prove the fact. 



A Witness called by one Party may not be cross-examined by 
that Party unless the Judge decides that the Witness is so 
hostile that the Party who called him should be allowed to 
cross-examine him. This rule applies even where one Party 
calls his Opponent as a Witness. 

PRICE v. MANNING. [1889] 

(58 L. J. Ch. 649 ; L. E. 42 Ch. D. 372 ; 61 L. T. 537 ; 
37 W. R. 785.) 

At the trial of this action before Kay, J., counsel for the 
plaintiff called the defendant to prove certain correspondence. 



378 EVIDENCE. 

The defendant was then cross-examined by his own counsel, 
and on re-examination plaintiff's counsel desired to treat the 
defendant as a hostile witness and to cross-examine him. 
Kay, J., refused to allow him to do so. 

Held, hi) lite Court of Appeal, that the learned judge was 
right. It is a matter of discretion of the judge who sees 
the witness, and can determine from Ins manner whether he 
is so hostile that the plaintiff should be allowed to cross- 
examine him. The judge having exercised his discretion, 
the Court of Appeal ought not to interfere with the exercise 
of that discretion. 

Note. — 28 Vict. c. 18, s. 3, lays down : — " A party producing a 
witness shall not be allowed to impeach his credit by general evi- 
dence of bad character, but he may, in case the witness shall, in the 
opinion of the judge, prove adverse, contradict him by other 
evidence, or, by leave of the j udge, prove that he has made at other 
times a statement inconsistent with his present testimony ; but 
before such last-mentioned proof can be given the circumstances of 
the supposed statement sufficient to designate the particular occa- 
sion must be mentioned tu the witness, and he must be asked 
whether or not he has made such statement." 



A Witness may refresh his Memory by referring to Entries made 
either by himself at the time the events occurred or where 
written by another in cases where he regularly examined 
the Entries soon after they were written. 

BUEEOUGH v. MAETIN. [1809] 
(2 Campbell, 112 ; 11 B. B, 679.) 

In an action on a charter-party, a witness was called to give 
an account of the voyage, and the log-book was laid before him 
for the purpose of refreshing his memory. Being asked whether 
he had written it himself he said that he had not, but that from 



DEPOSITIONS. 379 

time to time he examined the entries in it while the events were 
fresh in his recollection, and that he always found the entries 
accurate. 
This evidence, though objected to, was admitted. 

Held, by Lord Ellenborough : " If the witness looked at 
the log-book from time to time while the occurrences men- 
tioned in it ivere recent and fresh in his recollection, it is as 
good as if he had written the whole with his own hand. 
This collation gave him an ample opportunity to ascertain 
the correctness oj the entries ; and he may, therefore, refer 
to these, on the same principles that witnesses are allowed 
to refresh their memories by reading letters and other docu- 
ments which they themselves have written" 



DEPOSITIONS. 



The Deposition of a Witness taken before a Magistrate upon a 
criminal charge is admissible in case the Deponent is dead or 
so ill as not to be able to travel, or kept out of the way by 
the procurement of the Prisoner. 

E. v. SOAIFE. [1851] 

(20 L. J. M. C. 229 ; 15 Jur. 607 ; 17 Q. B. 242 ; 2 Den. 281 ; 
5 Cox, 243.) 

Scaife, Rooke and Smith were indicted for felony. At the 
trial, before Cress well, J., the deposition of a witness, Ann 
Garnett, which appeared to be regularly taken under 11 &amp; 12 
Vict. c. 42, s. 17, was tendered in evidence against the prisoner 
Smith under the following circumstances : — 

Garnett had been placed in lodgings by the police, in order 
to secure her attendance at the trial, and while there some 
persons had called upon her and given her money, and she had 
afterwards disappeared and could not be found when the trial 



380 EVIDENCE. 

took place. There was evidence to connect Smith with these 
persons, but none to show that either Scaife or Kooke was 
aware of the circumstances. 

The learned judge admitted the deposition to be read in 
evidence against the prisoners, on the ground that the witness 
had been kept out of the way by the prisoner Smith. The jury 
found Scaife and Rooke guilty, but acquitted Smith. 

A rule nisi for a new trial was afterwards obtained by Scaife 
and Rooke on the ground that this evidence was improperly 
admitted. 

Held, by the Court for Crown Cases Reserved, that the 
rule must be made absolute as the evidence against Scaife 
and Rooke was improperly admitted. 

The prisoner Smith having resorted to a contrivance to 
keep the witness out of the way, the evidence would be ad- 
missible against him, but it would not be admissible on 
that ground against the other prisoners.
